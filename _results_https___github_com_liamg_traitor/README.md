)
* Automatic help flag recognition of `-h`, `--help`, etc.
* Automatic help generation for commands and flags
* Automatically generated man pages for your application
* Automatically generated shell autocomplete for your application (bash, zsh, fish, powershell)
* Command aliases so you can change things without breaking them
* Easy subcommand-based CLIs: `app server`, `app fetch`, etc.
* Fully POSIX-compliant flags (including short & long versions)
* Global, local and cascading flags
* Intelligent suggestions (`app srver`... did you mean `app server`?)
* Nested subcommands
* Optional seamless integration with [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for 12-factor apps
* The flexibility to define your own help, usage, etc.
**Commands** represent actions, **Args** are things and **Flags** are modifiers for those actions.
**Example #1**: You want -, _, and . in flags to compare the same. aka --my-flag == --my_flag == --my.flag
**Example #1**: You want to deprecate a flag named "badflag" as well as inform the users what flag they should use instead.
**Example #2**: You want to alias two flags. aka --old-flag-name == --new-flag-name
**Example #2**: You want to keep a flag name "noshorthandflag" but deprecate its shortname "n".
**Example**:
**Example**: You have a flag named "secretFlag" that you need for internal use only and don't want it showing up in help text, or for its usage text to be available.
**Example**: You want to add the Go flags to the `CommandLine` flagset

It is possible to deprecate a flag, or just its shorthand. Deprecating a flag/shorthand hides it from help text and prints a usage message when the deprecated flag/shorthand is used.
It is possible to mark a flag as hidden, meaning it will still function as normal, however will not show up in usage/help text.
It is possible to set a custom flag name 'normalization function.' It allows flag names to be mutated both when created in the code and when used on the command line to some 'normalized' form. The 'normalized' form is used for comparison. Two examples of using the custom normalization func follow.

Run with the `-a`/`--any` flag to find potential vulnerabilities, attempting to exploit each, stopping if a root shell is gained. Again, add the `-p` flag if the current user password is known.
Run with the `-e`/`--exploit` flag to attempt to exploit a specific vulnerability and gain a root shell.
