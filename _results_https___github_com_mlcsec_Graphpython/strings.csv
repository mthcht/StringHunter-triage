 - add mfasweep functions
 - add option to deploy script which copies new windows web app link to all user desktops
 - check this is still valid 
 - could add option to alter pre-existing settings
 - port from AADInternals 
 - port mfa sweep and add to outsider commands
 - remove 
 - similar to other locator functions but for resolving directory role ids
 - todo
 - update to flag any privileged directory role app ids green
 - use IntuneWinAppUtil.exe to package the EXE/MSI and deploy to devices
 - user will have to packagae app prior
 -> need to add install/uninstall instruction batch script
 ...
 1. Find existing certs so we don't remove them in the patch req
 1. check existing permissions
 1. get current target script settings and encode new script content so we don't override anything
 2. patch app added our cert to the existing 
 2. patch perms
 2. patch script with updated script content

<p><em>Directory permissions are <strong>not recommended</strong> for use and might be deprecated in the future.</em></p>
<p><em>Group.</em>
<p><em>Mail.Read.Shared</em> is only valid for work or school accounts.</p>
<p><em>Mail.Read</em> is valid valid for both Microsoft accounts and work or school accounts.</p>
<p><em>Mail.ReadWrite.Shared</em> is only valid for work or school accounts.</p>
<p><em>Mail.ReadWrite</em> is valid valid for both Microsoft accounts and work or school accounts.</p>
<p><em>Mail.Send.Shared</em> is only valid for work or school accounts.</p>
<p><em>Mail.Send</em> is valid valid for both Microsoft accounts and work or school accounts.</p>
<p><em>MailboxSettings.Read</em> is valid valid for both Microsoft accounts and work or school accounts.</p>
<p><em>MailboxSettings.ReadWrite</em> is valid valid for both Microsoft accounts and work or school accounts.</p>
<p><em>profile</em> is an OpenID Connect (OIDC) scope.</p>
<p>Important</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The <em>Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy</em> permission allows an app to call <code>GET /applications</code> and <code>GET /servicePrincipals</code> endpoints to list all applications and service principals in the tenant. This scope of access has been allowed for the permission.</p>
<p>The <em>Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy</em> permission allows the same operations as <em>Application.ReadWrite.All</em> but only on applications and service principals that the calling app is an owner of.</p>
<p>These permissions aren't supported for personal Microsoft accounts.</p>
<p>With the <em>RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory</em> permission an application can read and write <code>/directoryRoles</code> and <code>/roleManagement/directory/
<p>You can use the OIDC scopes to specify artifacts that you want returned in Azure AD authorization and token requests. They are supported differently by the Azure AD v1.0 and v2.0 endpoints.</p>
