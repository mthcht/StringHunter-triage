        "body": "- A bug fix has been implemented for the execution of shell commands. All commands should now execute without causing the entire application to hang.\r\n- Protocol version checking between the Command and Control (C2) and Agent(s) has been incorporated. If a protocol version mismatch is detected, the agent will be disregarded by the C2.\r\n\r\nThe release of version \"3.0 Final\" signifies the culmination of this project. I will not be adding any further features; the objective of this PoC was to demonstrate the creation of a reliable and secure C2 utilizing FTP(S). You're encouraged to develop your own version with tailored functionalities. As an exercise, you might consider implementing multi-threading tasking to prevent the application from hanging during long-duration tasks.\r\n\r\nI will, however, continue to provide support for the project in terms of addressing potential bugs or opportunities for optimization."
        "body": "- Code Optimization: The codebase has been optimized for better performance.\r\n- Protocol Improvement: The communication protocol has been enhanced and is now more modular, allowing for greater flexibility.\r\n- Support for Different RSA Key-Pairs: C2 and agents can now operate with different RSA key-pairs, enabling them to coexist without conflict on the same FTP server.\r\n- Implementation of Dangerous Action Validation Delegate: A validation delegate has been implemented to prompt users for confirmation before executing potentially dangerous actions."
