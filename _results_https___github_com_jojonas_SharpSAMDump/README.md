# SharpSAMDump
Most of the code has been directly ported from James Forshaw's awesome book "Windows Security Internals: A Deep Dive into Windows Authentication, Authorization, and Auditing", chapter 10, listings 10.21 to 10.34.
This project implements SAM dumping via the registry in C#/.NET.
You can find James' PowerShell code in the [GitHub Repository tyranid/windows-security-internals](https://github.com/tyranid/windows-security-internals/blob/main/chapter_10/listing_10_21_to_10_34.ps1), where it has been published under the Apache 2.0 License.
