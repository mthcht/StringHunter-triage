	If set to `"suffix"`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.
	If set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).
	If set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.
	If set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).
	If set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.
	If set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).

  * _loose_ - boolean - if `true` enable parsing of key-less cookies like `=abc` and `=`, which are not RFC-compliant.
  * _maxAge_ - seconds - if set, the `Max-Age=` attribute _in seconds_ of the cookie.  May also be set to strings `"Infinity"` and `"-Infinity"` for non-expiry and immediate-expiry, respectively.  See `setMaxAge()`
  * _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation/access time of cookies

  * _rejectPublicSuffixes_ - boolean - default `true` - reject cookies with domains like "com" and "co.uk"
  * _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from url - indicates if this is a "Secure" API.  If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.

  - [validates schemas against meta-schema](#api-validateschema)
  - `"$id"` (default) - only use `$id` keyword as schema URI (as specified in JSON Schema draft-06/07), ignore `id` keyword (if it is present a warning will be logged).
  - `"all"` - all additional properties are removed, regardless of `additionalProperties` keyword in schema (and no validation is made for them).
  - `"array"` - in addition to coercions between scalar types, coerce scalar data to an array with one element and vice versa (as required by the schema).
  - `"auto"` - use both `$id` and `id` keywords as schema URI. If both are present (in the same schema object) and different the exception will be thrown during schema compilation.
  - `"empty"` - in addition to missing or undefined, use defaults for properties and items that are equal to `null` or `""` (an empty string).
  - `"fail"` (recommended) - if other validation keywords are used together with `$ref` the exception will be thrown when the schema is compiled. This option is recommended to make sure schema has no keywords that are ignored, which can be confusing.
  - `"fail"` - to log error and successfully compile schema but fail validation if this rule is checked.
  - `"failing"` - additional properties that fail schema validation will be removed (where `additionalProperties` keyword is `false` or schema).
  - `"fast"` (default) - simplified and fast validation (see [Formats](#formats) for details of which formats are available and affected by this option).
  - `"full"` - more restrictive and slow validation. E.g., 25:00:00 and 2015/14/33 will be invalid time and date in 'full' mode but it will be valid in 'fast' mode.
  - `"id"` - only use `id` keyword as schema URI (as specified in JSON Schema draft-04), ignore `$id` keyword (if it is present a warning will be logged).
  - `"ignore"` (default) - when `$ref` is used other keywords are ignored (as per [JSON Reference](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pbryan-zyp-json-ref-03#section-3) standard). A warning will be logged during the schema compilation.
  - `"ignore"` - to log error during compilation and always pass validation.
  - `"ignore"` - to log warning during schema compilation and always pass validation (the default behaviour in versions before 5.0.0). This option is not recommended, as it allows to mistype format name and it won't be validated without any error message. This behaviour is required by JSON Schema specification.
  - `"log"` - if an ignored default is present, log warning
  - `"log"` - if an unknown keyword is present, log warning
  - `"log"` - if the validation fails, log error.
  - `"shared"` (deprecated) - insert defaults by reference. If the default is an object, it will be shared by all instances of validated data. If you modify the inserted default in the validated data, it will be modified in the schema as well.
  - `[String]` - an array of unknown format names that will be ignored. This option can be used to allow usage of third party schemas with format(s) for which you don't have definitions, but still fail if another unknown format is used. If `format` keyword value is [$data reference](#data-reference) and it is not in this array the validation will fail.

  - `dnssec`: `.private` format output by `dnssec-keygen` etc.
  - `elapsedTime` Duration of the entire request/response in milliseconds (*deprecated*).
  - `element`: the element that requested the resource.
  - `end`: Character offset of the end of the comment.
  - `err`: either `null`, if nothing goes wrong, or an error, if the window could not be created
  - `error`: either `null`, if nothing goes wrong, or an `Error` object.
  - `exclusive` (boolean, the schema of `exclusiveMaximum` or `exclusiveMinimum`),
  - `false` (default) - NaN or Infinity will pass validation for numeric types
  - `false` (default) - do not use defaults
  - `false` (default) - ignored defaults are not reported
  - `false` (default) - no type coercion.
  - `false` (default) - not to remove additional properties
  - `false` (default) - unknown keywords are not reported
  - `false` (default): ignore $comment keyword.
  - `false` - do not transpile; if async functions are not supported an exception will be thrown.
  - `false` - ignore all format keywords.
  - `false` - logging is disabled.
  - `false` - skip schema validation.
  - `false` - to not inline referenced schemas (they will be compiled as separate functions).
  - `filename` -- Optional String, name for the key being parsed
  - `filename` -- Optional String, name for the key being parsed 
  - `hashType` -- String, the type of hash the fingerprint uses, either `ssh`
  - `limit` (number, the schema of the keyword),
  - `missingProperty` (required missing dependency - only the first one is reported currently)
  - `openssh`: new post-OpenSSH 6.5 internal format, produced by 
  - `passphrase` -- Optional String, encryption passphrase used to decrypt an
  - `pem`: supports both PKCS#1 and PKCS#8
  - `pkcs1`, `pkcs8`: variants of `pem`

  - `responseStartTime` Timestamp when the response began (in Unix Epoch milliseconds) (*deprecated*).
  - `rfc4253`: raw OpenSSH wire format
  - `ssh`, `openssh`: new post-OpenSSH 6.5 internal format, produced by
  - `ssh`: standard OpenSSH format,
  - `start`: Character offset of the start of the comment.
  - `text`: The content of the comment.
  - `throws` (`boolean`, default: `true`). If `JSON.parse` throws an error, pass this error to the callback.
  - `timingPhases` Contains the durations of each request phase. If there were redirects, the properties reflect the timings of the final request in the redirect chain:
  - `timingStart` Timestamp of the start of the request (in Unix Epoch milliseconds).
  - `timings` Contains event timestamps in millisecond resolution relative to `timingStart`. If there were redirects, the properties reflect the timings of the final request in the redirect chain:
  - `transpile` that transpiled asynchronous validation function. You can still use `transpile` option with [ajv-async](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-async) package. See [Asynchronous validation](#asynchronous-validation) for more information.
  - `true` (default) -  if the validation fails, throw the exception.
  - `true` (default) - if an unknown format is encountered the exception is thrown during schema compilation. If `format` keyword value is [$data reference](#data-reference) and it is unknown the validation will fail.
  - `true` (default) - if the reference cannot be resolved during compilation the exception is thrown. The thrown error has properties `missingRef` (with hash fragment) and `missingSchema` (without it). Both properties are resolved relative to the current base id (usually schema id, unless it was substituted).
  - `true` (default) - the referenced schemas that don't have refs in them are inlined, regardless of their size - that substantially improves performance at the cost of the bigger size of compiled schema functions.
  - `true` - NaN or Infinity will not pass validation for numeric types
  - `true` - always transpile with nodent.
  - `true` - coerce scalar data types.
  - `true` - if an ignored default is present, throw an error
  - `true` - if an unknown keyword is present, throw an error
  - `true` - insert defaults by value (object literal is used).
  - `true` - only additional properties with `additionalProperties` keyword equal to `false` are removed.
  - `true` - validate all keywords in the schemas with `$ref` (the default behaviour in versions before 5.0.0).
  - `true`: log the keyword value to console.
  - `type` -- String, the entity this fingerprint identifies, either `key` or
  - `undefined` (default) - transpile with [nodent](https://github.com/MatAtBread/nodent) if async functions are not supported.
  - `url`: a parsed URL object.
  - `window`: a brand new `window`, if there wasn't an error
  - all validation keywords (see [JSON Schema validation keywords](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md))
  - correct string lengths for strings with unicode pairs (can be turned off)
  - custom logger - it should have methods `log`, `warn` and `error`. If any of these methods is missing an exception will be thrown.
  - full support of remote refs (remote schemas have to be added with `addSchema` or compiled to be available)
  - function: pass the keyword value, its schema path and root schema to the specified function
  - integer number - to limit the maximum number of keywords of the schema that will be inlined.
  - support of circular references between schemas

 * Creates a custom transformation visitor that prefixes all calls to the
 * Decoding: BOM is stripped by default, unless overridden by passing `stripBOM: false` in options
 * Decoding: uses BOM and 'spaces heuristic' to determine input endianness. Default is UTF-16LE, but can be 
 * Disk number where file starts
 * Disk where central directory starts
 * Doesn't need native code compilation. Works on Windows and in sandboxed environments like [Cloud9](http://c9.io).
 * Don't block the JavaScript thread.
 * Emitting a 'progress' event on write.
 * Encoding: No BOM added, unless overridden by `addBOM: true` option.
 * Encoding: uses UTF-16LE and writes BOM by default. Use `addBOM: false` to override.
 * Encrypt/decrypt methods in nodejs 0.12.x and io.js using native implementation (> 40x speed boost).
 * Faster than [node-iconv](https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-iconv) (see below for performance comparison).
 * Fixed PSS encode/verify methods with max salt length.     
 * Fixed a issue when the key was generated by 1 bit smaller than specified. It may slow down the generation of large keys.    
 * Fixed environment detection in web worker.
 * Fixed some regex issue causing catastrophic backtracking.
 * Follow the spec.
 * I wrote a couple blog pots on this, [part 1][my-blog-1] and [part 2][my-blog-2]
 * If you want to detect UTF-8 BOM when decoding other encodings, use [node-autodetect-decoder-stream](https://github.com/danielgindi/node-autodetect-decoder-stream) module.
 * Implemented native js signing and verifying for browsers.
 * Importing keys from PEM now is less dependent on non-key data in files.
 * Improve work with not properly trimming PEM strings.
 * In-browser usage via [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) (~180k gzip compressed with Buffer shim included).
 * Intuitive encode/decode API
 * Keep memory usage under control.
 * License changed from BSD to MIT. 
 * License: MIT.
 * Method `.importKey(key, [format])` now has second argument.
 * Never crash (if used properly).
 * Now used old hash APIs for webpack compatible.
 * Number of central directory records on this disk
 * Property `key.options` now mark as private. Added `key.setOptions(options)` method.
 * Provide `callback` parameters where they are allowed, and check the `err` parameter.
 * React Native is supported (need to explicitly `npm install` two more modules: `buffer` and `stream`).
 * Reads a source file that may (or may not) contain ES6 classes *or* arrow
 * Reads a source file that may (or may not) contain ES6 classes, transforms it
 * Removed lodash from dependencies.
 * Signing now supports `'md5'`, `'ripemd160'`, `'sha1'`, `'sha256'`, `'sha512'` hash algorithms in both environments
 * Some changes in internal api.
 * Streaming support for Node v0.10+
 * This is a useful shorthand when the only option you need is "cause".
 * This is a useful shorthand when you don't need any options at all.
 * This is the most general form.  You can specify any supported options
 * Typescript [type definition file](https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite/blob/master/lib/index.d.ts) included.
 * Used in popular projects like [Express.js (body_parser)](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser), 
 * [Deprecated] Can extend Node.js primitives (buffers, streams) to support all iconv-lite encodings.

* **Yoshua Wyuts** ([@yoshuawuyts](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts)) &lt;yoshuawuyts@gmail.com&gt;
* **abort**(< _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Aborts the current data transfer (e.g. from get(), put(), or list()). `callback` has 1 parameter: < _Error_ >err.
* **append**(< _mixed_ >input, < _string_ >destPath, [< _boolean_ >useCompression, ]< _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Same as **put()**, except if `destPath` already exists, it will be appended to instead of overwritten.
* **ascii**(< _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Sets the transfer data type to ASCII. `callback` has 1 parameter: < _Error_ >err.
* **binary**(< _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Sets the transfer data type to binary (default at time of connection). `callback` has 1 parameter: < _Error_ >err.
* **cdup**(< _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Changes the working directory to the parent of the current directory. `callback` has 1 parameter: < _Error_ >err.
* **close**(< _boolean_ >hadErr) - Emitted when the connection has fully closed.
* **connect**(< _object_ >config) - _(void)_ - Connects to an FTP server. Valid config properties:
* **cwd**(< _string_ >path, < _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Changes the current working directory to `path`. `callback` has 2 parameters: < _Error_ >err, < _string_ >currentDir. Note: `currentDir` is only given if the server replies with the path in the response text.
* **delete**(< _string_ >path, < _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Deletes a file, `path`, on the server. `callback` has 1 parameter: < _Error_ >err.
* **destroy**() - _(void)_ - Closes the connection to the server immediately.
* **end**() - Emitted when the connection has ended.
* **end**() - _(void)_ - Closes the connection to the server after any/all enqueued commands have been executed.
* **error**(< _Error_ >err) - Emitted when an error occurs. In case of protocol-level errors, `err` contains a 'code' property that references the related 3-digit FTP response code.
* **fieldName** (required): name of the field to index. Use the dot notation to index a field in a nested document.
* **get**(< _string_ >path, [< _boolean_ >useCompression, ]< _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Retrieves a file at `path` from the server. `useCompression` defaults to false. `callback` has 2 parameters: < _Error_ >err, < _ReadableStream_ >fileStream.
* **greeting**(< _string_ >msg) - Emitted after connection. `msg` is the text the server sent upon connection.
* **lastMod**(< _string_ >path, < _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Retrieves the last modified date and time for `path`. `callback` has 2 parameters: < _Error_ >err, < _Date_ >lastModified.
* **list**([< _string_ >path, ][< _boolean_ >useCompression, ]< _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Retrieves the directory listing of `path`. `path` defaults to the current working directory. `useCompression` defaults to false. `callback` has 2 parameters: < _Error_ >err, < _array_ >list. `list` is an array of objects with these properties:
* **listSafe**([< _string_ >path, ][< _boolean_ >useCompression, ]< _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Similar to list(), except the directory is temporarily changed to `path` to retrieve the directory listing. This is useful for servers that do not handle characters like spaces and quotes in directory names well for the LIST command. This function is "optional" because it relies on pwd() being available.
* **logout**(< _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Logout the user from the server. `callback` has 1 parameter: < _Error_ >err.
* **mkdir**(< _string_ >path, [< _boolean_ >recursive, ]< _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Creates a new directory, `path`, on the server. `recursive` is for enabling a 'mkdir -p' algorithm and defaults to false. `callback` has 1 parameter: < _Error_ >err.
* **put**(< _mixed_ >input, < _string_ >destPath, [< _boolean_ >useCompression, ]< _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Sends data to the server to be stored as `destPath`. `input` can be a ReadableStream, a Buffer, or a path to a local file. `useCompression` defaults to false. `callback` has 1 parameter: < _Error_ >err.
* **pwd**(< _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Retrieves the current working directory. `callback` has 2 parameters: < _Error_ >err, < _string_ >cwd.
* **ready**() - Emitted when connection and authentication were sucessful.
* **rename**(< _string_ >oldPath, < _string_ >newPath, < _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Renames `oldPath` to `newPath` on the server. `callback` has 1 parameter: < _Error_ >err.
* **restart**(< _integer_ >byteOffset, < _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Sets the file byte offset for the next file transfer action (get/put) to `byteOffset`. `callback` has 1 parameter: < _Error_ >err.
* **rmdir**(< _string_ >path, [< _boolean_ >recursive, ]< _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Removes a directory, `path`, on the server. If `recursive`, this call will delete the contents of the directory if it is not empty. `callback` has 1 parameter: < _Error_ >err.
* **site**(< _string_ >command, < _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Sends `command` (e.g. 'CHMOD 755 foo', 'QUOTA') using SITE. `callback` has 3 parameters: < _Error_ >err, < _string >responseText, < _integer_ >responseCode.
* **size**(< _string_ >path, < _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Retrieves the size of `path`. `callback` has 2 parameters: < _Error_ >err, < _integer_ >numBytes.
* **sparse** (optional, defaults to `false`): don't index documents for which the field is not defined. Use this option along with "unique" if you want to accept multiple documents for which it is not defined.
* **status**(< _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Retrieves human-readable information about the server's status. `callback` has 2 parameters: < _Error_ >err, < _string_ >status.
* **system**(< _function_ >callback) - _(void)_ - Retrieves the server's operating system. `callback` has 2 parameters: < _Error_ >err, < _string_ >OS.
* **unique** (optional, defaults to `false`): enforce field uniqueness. Note that a unique index will raise an error if you try to index two documents for which the field is not defined.
* 0 elements, returns `null`
* 1 element, returns the sole error

* If a Date is expected, the surrounding `#` can be omitted from date literals. Eg. `2011-11-11` is `new Date('2011-11-11')`.
* If a RegExp is expected, no flags need to be specified, and the regex is not using any of the special characters,the opening and closing `/` can be omitted - this will have the affect of setting the source of the regex to the input. Eg. `regex` is `/regex/`.
* If a String is expected, and only a String, all characters of the input (including any special ones) will become part of the output. Eg. `[({})]` is `"[({})]"`, and `"hi"` is `'"hi"'`.
* If a tuple is expected, and it is the root node (at the top level), the opening `(` and closing `)` can be omitted. Eg. `1, a` is `(1, a)` (is `[1, 'a']`).
* If an Array is expected, and it is the root node (at the top level), the opening `[` and closing `]` can be omitted. Eg. `1,2,3` is `[1,2,3]`.

* `afterSerialization` (optional): hook you can use to transform data after it was serialized and before it is written to disk. Can be used for example to encrypt data before writing database to disk. This function takes a string as parameter (one line of an NeDB data file) and outputs the transformed string, **which must absolutely not contain a `\n` character** (or data will be lost).
* `aliasSeparator` is an optional string, separates multiple names from each other - default: ' ,'
* `alias` is an optional string or array of strings which specify any aliases for the option

* `argv` - Array to be passed to `process.argv`.
* `arrayBuffer` {ArrayBuffer} The `.buffer` property of a `TypedArray` or
* `array` {Array}
* `autoload` (optional, defaults to `false`): if used, the database will automatically be loaded from the datafile upon creation (you don't need to call `loadDatabase`). Any command issued before load is finished is buffered and will be executed when load is done.
* `beforeDeserialization` (optional): inverse of `afterSerialization`. Make sure to include both and not just one or you risk data loss. For the same reason, make sure both functions are inverses of one another. Some failsafe mechanisms are in place to prevent data loss if you misuse the serialization hooks: NeDB checks that never one is declared without the other, and checks that they are reverse of one another by testing on random strings of various lengths. In addition, if too much data is detected as corrupt, NeDB will refuse to start as it could mean you're not using the deserialization hook corresponding to the serialization hook used before (see below).

Also, please follow the <a href="#bug-reporting-guidelines">bug reporting guidelines</a> and check the <a href="https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb/wiki/Change-log" target="_blank">change log</a> before submitting an already fixed bug :)
**IMPORTANT**: Timeout is not effective for NodeVM so it is not immune to `while (true) {}` or similar evil.
**IMPORTANT**: Timeout is only effective on synchronous code that you run through `run`. Timeout does **NOT** work on any method returned by VM. There are some situations when timeout doesn't work - see [#244](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/pull/244).
**IMPORTANT**: VM2 requires Node.js 6 or newer.
**IMPORTANT:** It is not possible to freeze objects that have already been proxied to the VM.

**In-browser:** `npm install marked`
**Included tools:**
**Key Features**:
**Kind**: Exported class  
**Kind**: instance method of [<code>SymbolTree</code>](#exp_module_symbol-tree--SymbolTree)  
**Locale-sensitive string comparisons**
**Lookbehind:** A [collection of short functions](https://gist.github.com/2387872) is available that makes it easy to simulate infinite-length leading lookbehind.
**NOTE**: Custom `Cookie` properties will be discarded. If you want a property to be serialized, add the property name to the `Cookie.serializableProperties` Array.
**NOTE**: Custom `Cookie` properties will be discarded. In tough-cookie 1.x, since there was no `.toJSON` method explicitly defined, all enumerable properties were captured. If you want a property to be serialized, add the property name to the `Cookie.serializableProperties` Array.
**NOTE**: if you want to have custom `Cookie` properties serialized, add the property name to `Cookie.serializableProperties`.
**NOTE:** You can still use the native Node.js methods. They are promisified and copied over to `fs-extra`. See [notes on `fs.read()` & `fs.write()`](docs/fs-read-write.md)
**Note** that the function returned from `getSerialize` is stateful for now, so
**Note**: New method as of `tough-cookie` version 2.5, so not all Stores will implement this, plus some stores may choose not to implement this.
**Note**: Since JavaScript's `Date` is limited to a 1ms precision, cookies within the same milisecond are entirely possible. This is especially true when using the `now` option to `.setCookie()`. The `.creationIndex` property is a per-process global counter, assigned during construction with `new Cookie()`. This preserves the spirit of the RFC sorting: older cookies go first. This works great for `MemoryCookieStore`, since `Set-Cookie` headers are parsed in order, but may not be so great for distributed systems. Sophisticated `Store`s may wish to set this to some other _logical clock_ such that if cookies A and B are created in the same millisecond, but cookie A is created before cookie B, then `A.creationIndex < B.creationIndex`. If you want to alter the global counter, which you probably _shouldn't_ do, it's stored in `Cookie.cookiesCreated`.
**Note**: This module does not work in the browser. The client in the docs is a
**Note**: as of [`v2.0.0`](https://github.com/ahmadnassri/node-har-validator/releases/tag/v2.0.0) this module defaults to Promise based API.
**Note**: not all Stores can implement this due to technical limitations, so it is optional.
**Note**: prior to 1.0.x, several of these functions took a `strict` parameter. This has since been removed from the API as it was no longer necessary.
**Note**: you can't change a document's _id.
**Note:** At least two proxies must be provided for the chain to be established.
**Note:** Chaining is only supported when using the SOCKS connect command, and chaining can only be done through the special factory chaining function.
**Note:** If a callback function is provided, the promise will always resolve regardless of an error occurring. Please be sure to exclusively use either promises or callbacks when using this factory function.
**Note:** Insert/Writing to a position beyond the currently tracked internal Buffer will zero pad to your offset.
**Note:** SmartBuffer is fully documented with Typescript definitions as well as jsdocs so your favorite editor/IDE will have intellisense.
**Note:** The associate TCP connection to the proxy must remain open for the UDP relay to work.
**Note:** You can call `.defaults()` on the wrapper that is returned from
**Note:** `request.defaults()` **does not** modify the global request API;
**Note:** prior to v1.2.0 this class was called `TreeSerializer`. However, it's still accessible as `parse5.TreeSerializer` for backward compatibility.
**Note:** socks includes full TypeScript definitions. These can even be used without using TypeScript as most IDEs (such as VS Code) will use these type definition files for auto completion intellisense even in JavaScript files.
**Note:** the `ensureIndex` function creates the index synchronously, so it's best to use it at application startup. It's quite fast so it doesn't increase startup time much (35 ms for a collection containing 10,000 documents).
**Note:** you must call `config()` _before_ you interact with your data. This

- You can implement dynamic resolution of the referenced schemas using `compileAsync` method. In this way you can store schemas in any system (files, web, database, etc.) and reference them without explicitly adding to Ajv instance. See [Asynchronous schema compilation](#asynchronous-schema-compilation).
- You can pass the identifier of the schema as the second parameter of `addSchema` method or as a property name in `schemas` option. This identifier can be used instead of (or in addition to) schema $id.
- You cannot have the same $id (or the schema identifier) used for more than one schema - the exception will be thrown.
- You don't have to host your schema files at the URIs that you use as schema $id. These URIs are only used to identify the schemas, and according to JSON Schema specification validators should not expect to be able to download the schemas from these URIs.

- _$comment_ (NEW in Ajv version 6.0): log or pass the value of `$comment` keyword to a function. Option values:
- _$data_: an optional `true` value to support [$data reference](#data-reference) as the value of custom keyword. The reference will be resolved at validation time. If the keyword has meta-schema it would be extended to allow $data and it will be used to validate the resolved value. Supporting $data reference requires that keyword has validating function (as the only option or in addition to compile, macro or inline function).
- _$data_: support [$data references](#data-reference). Draft 6 meta-schema that is added by default will be extended to allow them. If you want to use another meta-schema you need to use $dataMetaSchema method to add support for $data reference. See [API](#api).
- _Allowed_: `/url to be skipped/` or `false`
- _Allowed_: `["script", "frame", "iframe", "link"]` or `false`
- _Allowed_: `["script"]` or `false`
- _Default for `jsdom.env`_: `false`
- _Default_: `["script"]`
- _Default_: `false` (allow all)
- _Example_: `/http:\/\/example.org/js/bad\.js/`
- _JSON pointer_: from the root schema to the current schema object
- __No fallbacks.__ Instead of naively returning the first available type,
- _addUsedSchema_: by default methods `compile` and `validate` add schemas to the instance if they have `$id` (or `id`) property that doesn't start with "#". If `$id` is present and it is not unique the exception will be thrown. Set this option to `false` to skip adding schemas to the instance and the `$id` uniqueness check when these methods are used. This option does not affect `addSchema` method.
- _allErrors_: check all rules collecting all errors. Default is to return after the first error.
- _async_: an optional `true` value if `validate` is an asynchronous function; in this case it should return a promise that resolves with a value `true` or `false`.
- _async_: an optional `true` value if the validation function is asynchronous (whether it is compiled or passed in _validate_ property); in this case it should return a promise that resolves with a value `true` or `false`. This option is ignored in case of "macro" and "inline" keywords.
- _cache_: an optional instance of cache to store compiled schemas using stable-stringified schema as a key. For example, set-associative cache [sacjs](https://github.com/epoberezkin/sacjs) can be used. If not passed then a simple hash is used which is good enough for the common use case (a limited number of statically defined schemas). Cache should have methods `put(key, value)`, `get(key)`, `del(key)` and `clear()`.
- _coerceTypes_: change data type of data to match `type` keyword. See the example in [Coercing data types](#coercing-data-types) and [coercion rules](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/COERCION.md). Option values:
- _compare_: an optional comparison function that accepts two strings and compares them according to the format meaning. This function is used with keywords `formatMaximum`/`formatMinimum` (defined in [ajv-keywords](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-keywords) package). It should return `1` if the first value is bigger than the second value, `-1` if it is smaller and `0` if it is equal.
- _compile_: compiling function
- _dataPath_: the path to the part of the data that was validated. By default `dataPath` uses JavaScript property access notation (e.g., `".prop[1].subProp"`). When the option `jsonPointers` is true (see [Options](#options)) `dataPath` will be set using JSON pointer standard (e.g., `"/prop/1/subProp"`).
- _data_: the data validated by the keyword (added with `verbose` option).
- _date-time_: date-time from the same source (time-zone is mandatory). `date`, `time` and `date-time` validate ranges in `full` mode and only regexp in `fast` mode (see [options](#options)).
- _date_: full-date according to [RFC3339](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6).
- _dependencies_: an optional list of properties that must be present in the parent schema - it will be checked during schema compilation
- _email_: email address.
- _errorDataPath_ (deprecated): set `dataPath` to point to 'object' (default) or to 'property' when validating keywords `required`, `additionalProperties` and `dependencies`.
- _errors_: an optional boolean or string `"full"` indicating whether keyword returns errors. If this property is not set Ajv will determine if the errors were set in case of failed validation.
- _extendRefs_: validation of other keywords when `$ref` is present in the schema. Option values:
- _format_: formats validation mode. Option values:
- _formats_: an object with custom formats. Keys and values will be passed to `addFormat` method.
- _hostname_: host name according to [RFC1034](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034#section-3.5).
- _index/property_: index or property name in the array/object containing multiple schemas; in the example above for `{type: 'string'}` the property name is `'foo'`
- _inlineRefs_: Affects compilation of referenced schemas. Option values:
- _inline_: compiling function that returns code (as string)
- _ipv4_: IP address v4.
- _ipv6_: IP address v6.
- _json-pointer_: JSON-pointer according to [RFC6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901).
- _jsonPointers_: set `dataPath` property of errors using [JSON Pointers](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) instead of JavaScript property access notation.
- _keyword_: validation keyword.
- _keywords_: an object with custom keywords. Keys and values will be passed to `addKeyword` method.
- _loadSchema_: asynchronous function that will be used to load remote schemas when `compileAsync` [method](#api-compileAsync) is used and some reference is missing (option `missingRefs` should NOT be 'fail' or 'ignore'). This function should accept remote schema uri as a parameter and return a Promise that resolves to a schema. See example in [Asynchronous compilation](#asynchronous-schema-compilation).
- _logger_: sets the logging method. Default is the global `console` object that should have methods `log`, `warn` and `error`. See [Error logging](#error-logging). Option values:
- _loopRequired_: by default `required` keyword is compiled into a single expression (or a sequence of statements in `allErrors` mode). In case of a very large number of properties in this keyword it may result in a very big validation function. Pass integer to set the number of properties above which `required` keyword will be validated in a loop - smaller validation function size but also worse performance.
- _macro_: macro function
- _message_: the standard error message (can be excluded with option `messages` set to false).
- _messages_: Include human-readable messages in errors. `true` by default. `false` can be passed when custom messages are used (e.g. with [ajv-i18n](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-i18n)).
- _metaSchema_: an optional meta-schema for keyword schema
- _meta_: add [meta-schema](http://json-schema.org/documentation.html) so it can be used by other schemas (true by default). If an object is passed, it will be used as the default meta-schema for schemas that have no `$schema` keyword. This default meta-schema MUST have `$schema` keyword.
- _missingRefs_: handling of missing referenced schemas. Option values:
- _modifying_: `true` MUST be passed if keyword modifies data
- _multipleOfPrecision_: by default `multipleOf` keyword is validated by comparing the result of division with parseInt() of that result. It works for dividers that are bigger than 1. For small dividers such as 0.01 the result of the division is usually not integer (even when it should be integer, see issue [#84](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/84)). If you need to use fractional dividers set this option to some positive integer N to have `multipleOf` validated using this formula: `Math.abs(Math.round(division) - division) < 1e-N` (it is slower but allows for float arithmetics deviations).
- _nullable_: support keyword "nullable" from [Open API 3 specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/data-types/).
- _ownProperties_: by default Ajv iterates over all enumerable object properties; when this option is `true` only own enumerable object properties (i.e. found directly on the object rather than on its prototype) are iterated. Contributed by @mbroadst.
- _params_: the object with the additional information about error that can be used to create custom error messages (e.g., using [ajv-i18n](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-i18n) package). See below for parameters set by all keywords.
- _parent JSON pointer_: from the root schema to the parent schema object (see below)
- _parent keyword_: the keyword inside which this schema appears (e.g. `properties`, `anyOf`, etc.)
- _parent schema_: not necessarily parent object/array; in the example above the parent schema for `{type: 'string'}` is the root schema
- _parentSchema_: the schema containing the keyword (added with `verbose` option)
- _passContext_: pass validation context to custom keyword functions. If this option is `true` and you pass some context to the compiled validation function with `validate.call(context, data)`, the `context` will be available as `this` in your custom keywords. By default `this` is Ajv instance.
- _processCode_: an optional function to process generated code before it is passed to Function constructor. It can be used to either beautify (the validating function is generated without line-breaks) or to transpile code. Starting from version 5.0.0 this option replaced options:
- _regex_: tests whether a string is a valid regular expression by passing it to RegExp constructor.
- _relative-json-pointer_: relative JSON-pointer according to [this draft](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-luff-relative-json-pointer-00).
- _removeAdditional_: remove additional properties - see example in [Filtering data](#filtering-data). This option is not used if schema is added with `addMetaSchema` method. Option values:
- _root schema_: the schema passed to `traverse` object
- _schemaId_: this option defines which keywords are used as schema URI. Option value:
- _schemaPath_: the path (JSON-pointer as a URI fragment) to the schema of the keyword that failed validation.
- _schema_: an optional `false` value used with "validate" keyword to not pass schema
- _schema_: the current schema object
- _schema_: the schema of the keyword (added with `verbose` option).
- _schemas_: an array or object of schemas that will be added to the instance. In case you pass the array the schemas must have IDs in them. When the object is passed the method `addSchema(value, key)` will be called for each schema in this object.
- _serialize_: an optional function to serialize schema to cache key. Pass `false` to use schema itself as a key (e.g., if WeakMap used as a cache). By default [fast-json-stable-stringify](https://github.com/epoberezkin/fast-json-stable-stringify) is used.
- _sourceCode_: add `sourceCode` property to validating function (for debugging; this code can be different from the result of toString call).
- _statements_: `true` can be passed in case inline keyword generates statements (as opposed to expression)
- _strictDefaults_: report ignored `default` keywords in schemas. Option values:
- _strictKeywords_: report unknown keywords in schemas. Option values:
- _strictNumbers_: validate numbers strictly, failing validation for NaN and Infinity. Option values:
- _time_: time with optional time-zone.
- _transpile_: Requires [ajv-async](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-async) package. It determines whether Ajv transpiles compiled asynchronous validation function. Option values:
- _type_: an optional type of data that the format applies to. It can be `"string"` (default) or `"number"` (see https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/291#issuecomment-259923858). If the type of data is different, the validation will pass.
- _type_: optional string or array of strings with data type(s) that the keyword applies to. If not present, the keyword will apply to all types.
- _unicode_: calculate correct length of strings with unicode pairs (true by default). Pass `false` to use `.length` of strings that is faster, but gives "incorrect" lengths of strings with unicode pairs - each unicode pair is counted as two characters.
- _uniqueItems_: validate `uniqueItems` keyword (true by default).
- _unknownFormats_: handling of unknown formats. Option values:
- _uri-reference_: URI reference, including full and relative URIs.
- _uri-template_: URI template according to [RFC6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570)
- _uri_: full URI.
- _url_ (deprecated): [URL record](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url).
- _useDefaults_: replace missing or undefined properties and items with the values from corresponding `default` keywords. Default behaviour is to ignore `default` keywords. This option is not used if schema is added with `addMetaSchema` method. See examples in [Assigning defaults](#assigning-defaults). Option values:
- _uuid_: Universally Unique IDentifier according to [RFC4122](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122).
- _valid_: pass `true`/`false` to pre-define validation result, the result returned from validation function will be ignored. This option cannot be used with macro keywords.
- _validateSchema_: validate added/compiled schemas against meta-schema (true by default). `$schema` property in the schema can be http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema or absent (draft-07 meta-schema will be used) or can be a reference to the schema previously added with `addMetaSchema` method. Option values:
- _validate_: a string, RegExp or a function as described above.
- _validate_: validating function
- _verbose_: include the reference to the part of the schema (`schema` and `parentSchema`) and validated data in errors (false by default).
- `"3-example"`: invalid as numbers are not allowed to be the first character in a keyword
- `"example"`: valid, but not recommended as it could collide with future versions of JSON Schema etc.
- `"xyz-example"`: valid, and uses prefix for the xyz project to avoid name collisions.
- `$comment` (NEW in draft-07): information for developers. With option `$comment` Ajv logs or passes the comment string to the user-supplied function. See [Options](#options).
- `$ref` - property `ref` with the referenced schema URI.
- `$ref` is resolved as the uri-reference using schema $id as the base URI (see the example).
- `--allow-await-outside-function`: Allows top-level `await` expressions.
- `--allow-hash-bang`: If the code starts with the characters #! (as
- `--allow-hash-bang`: If the code starts with the characters #! (as in a shellscript), the first line will be treated as a comment.
- `--compact`: No whitespace is used in the AST output.
- `--ecma3|--ecma5|--ecma6`: Sets the ECMAScript version to parse. Default is
- `--ecma3|--ecma5|--ecma6|--ecma7|--ecma8|--ecma9|--ecma10`: Sets the ECMAScript version
- `--help`: Print the usage information and quit.
- `--locations`: Attaches a "loc" object to each node with "start" and
- `--module`: Sets the parsing mode to `"module"`. Is set to `"script"` otherwise.
- `--silent`: Do not output the AST, just return the exit status.
- `.base`: The base address of the network block as a string (eg: 216.240.32.0). Base does not give an indication of the size of the network block.
- `.bitmask`: The netmask as a number of bits in the network portion of the address for this block (eg: 24).
- `.broadcast`: The blocks broadcast address (eg: 192.168.1.0/24 => 192.168.1.255)
- `.charset` - the default charset associated with this type, if any.
- `.compressible` - whether a file of this type can be gzipped.
- `.contains(ip or block)`: Returns a true if the IP number `ip` is part of the network. That is, a true value is returned if `ip` is between `base` and `broadcast`. If a Netmask object or a block is given, it returns true only of the given block fits inside the network.
- `.extensions[]` - known extensions associated with this mime type.
- `.first`, `.last`: First and last useable address
- `.forEach(fn)`: Similar to the Array prototype method. It loops through all the useable addresses, ie between `first` and `last`.
- `.hostmask`: The host mask which is the opposite of the netmask (eg: 0.0.0.255).
- `.mask`: The netmask as a string (eg: 255.255.255.0).
- `.next(count)`: Without a `count`, return the next block of the same size after the current one. With a count, return the Nth block after the current one. A count of -1 returns the previous block. Undef will be returned if out of legal address space.
- `.size`: The number of IP addresses in a block (eg: 256).
- `.source` - where the mime type is defined.
- `.toString()`: The netmask in base/bitmask format (e.g., '216.240.32.0/24')
- `Buffer.alloc(size)` - create a zero-filled buffer
- `Buffer.allocUnsafe(size)` - create an uninitialized buffer with given size
- `Buffer.from(value)` - convert from any type to a buffer
- `NO_PROXY=*` disables all proxies.
- `Number(str)` returns 0 when `str` is the empty string (`''`).

- http://hg.nginx.org/nginx/raw-file/default/conf/mime.types
- http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types
- http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml
- i18n error messages support with [ajv-i18n](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-i18n) package
- implement custom data processors that modify your data (`modifying` option MUST be used in keyword definition) and/or create side effects while the data is being validated
- in `if` subschema of `switch` keyword
- in schemas generated by custom macro keywords
- in schemas inside `anyOf`, `oneOf` and `not` (see [#42](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/42))
- inline compilation function that should return code (as string) that will be inlined in the currently compiled schema.
- it exports a function
- it's full reference (id)
- key passed to `addSchema`
- keywords `switch`, `patternRequired`, `formatMaximum` / `formatMinimum` and `formatExclusiveMaximum` / `formatExclusiveMinimum` from [JSON Schema extension proposals](https://github.com/json-schema/json-schema/wiki/v5-Proposals) with [ajv-keywords](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-keywords) package
- lie.js/lie.min.js makes 'Promise' available in global scope (or since it's a UMD `Promise` will be available through a CJS or AMD loader if it's available instead)
- lie.polyfill.js/lie.polyfill.min.js adds 'Promise' to the global scope only if it's not already defined (not a UMD).
- macro function
- make your schemas more expressive, less verbose and closer to your application domain
- making assessment of "format" implementations in Ajv.
- migrate schemas to draft-07 (using [json-schema-migrate](https://github.com/epoberezkin/json-schema-migrate))
- missing schema can't be loaded (`loadSchema` returns a Promise that rejects).
- none
- not in `properties` or `items` subschemas
- npm (Node.js package manager)
- referenced schemas
- replacing format implementations provided by Ajv with your own implementations of "format" keyword that either uses different regular expressions or another approach to format validation. Please see [addFormat](#api-addformat) method.
- reporting changes in data after validation in [JSON-patch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) format
- schema (or some loaded/referenced schema) is invalid.
- schemas are compiled to ES6 code (ES5 code generation is supported with an option).
- simplify your schemas
- supports [browsers](#using-in-browser) and Node.js 0.10-14.x
- testing expected validity of data against JSON Schema
- the support for JSON-Schema draft-04 is removed - if you have schemas using "id" attributes you have to replace them with "\$id" (or continue using version 6 that will be supported until 02/28/2021).
- this function accepts ajv instance as the first parameter and returns the same instance to allow chaining
- this function can accept an optional configuration as the second parameter
- to improve reliability and maintainability the code is migrated to TypeScript.
- to make code injection from untrusted schemas impossible, [code generation](./docs/codegen.md) is fully re-written to be safe.
- to reduce the mistakes in JSON schemas and unexpected validation results, [strict mode](./docs/strict-mode.md) is added - it prohibits ignored or ambiguous JSON Schema elements.
- to simplify Ajv extensions, the new keyword API that is used by pre-defined keywords is available to user-defined keywords - it is much easier to define any keywords now, especially with subschemas.
- using `format: 'fast'` option that simplifies some of the regular expressions (although it does not guarantee that they are safe).
- validating certain data can be slow
- validating data file(s) against JSON Schema
- validation function
- wget: 
- works in node.js (8+) and browsers (IE9+)

// for use with Node-style callbacks...
// from a full path
// from path.parent.node all the way to path.node by accessing each
// function that interacts with a rate-limited REST api.
// functions for working with versions
// generate 5 users
// generate code
// grab data on .js files
// if your tree doesn't enforce a unique constraint
// in the browser if you want to load ajv-async bundle separately you can:
// initiate the WebSocket connection
// instance methods
// ipv4 long conversion
// is a Node object, path.parentPath.node is distinct from
// js classes are fun
// just a JSON-equivalent object.
// let's see how we can modify the array field atomically
// load the whole API at once in a single object
// logs `foo\n` 5 times, and then `ok`
// low-level comparators between versions
// m1 is flowing, so it writes the data to m2 immediately
// m2 is flowing, so it writes the data to m3 immediately
// m2's write returned true, so m1 is still flowing, returns true
// m3 is flowing, so it writes the data to m4 immediately
// m3's write returned true, so m2 is still flowing, returns true
// m4 is flowing, so it fires the 'data' event immediately, returns true
// m4's write returned true, so m3 is still flowing, returns true
// mapReverse is also a thing
// maps to a `fs.ReadStream` instance
// method will be POST and Content-Type: 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8'
// missing features
// must be given for each.
// need to keep around a few small chunks of memory
// non-string keys ARE fully supported
// now access req.text
// now access this.text
// now go and do stuff with it...
// now myDoubledList contains ['barbar', 2, 4, 6, 'foofoo']
// null
// null input.
// of course pop() and shift() are there, too
// on next tick (4)
// operate on buffers in-place

// p1 sees p2's 'drain', calls resume(), emits 'resume' and 'drain' on next
// p2 returns false and buffers, pausing p1, then writes to p3 on next tick (2)
// p2 sees p3's 'drain', calls resume(), emits 'resume' and 'drain' on next tick (6)
// p3 returns false and buffers, pausing p2, then writes to p4 on next tick (3)

// to illustrate usage, we'll create a utility function to request and pipe to stdout
// to save the modified contents of that file:

// transform code to array of tokens:
// typeCheck(type, input, options);
// types newly introduced by def(...)).

// usually it will add/modify request headers, but you can also sign the query:
// var a = function(param1)  {return param1;}; function FooClass(){"use strict";}

Ajv allows defining keywords with:
Ajv can be extended with plugins that add custom keywords, formats or functions to process generated code. When such plugin is published as npm package it is recommended that it follows these conventions:
Ajv compiles asynchronous schemas to [es7 async functions](http://tc39.github.io/ecmascript-asyncawait/) that can optionally be transpiled with [nodent](https://github.com/MatAtBread/nodent). Async functions are supported in Node.js 7+ and all modern browsers. You can also supply any other transpiler as a function via `processCode` option. See [Options](#options).
Ajv compiles schemas to functions and caches them in all cases (using schema serialized with [fast-json-stable-stringify](https://github.com/epoberezkin/fast-json-stable-stringify) or a custom function as a key), so that the next time the same schema is used (not necessarily the same object instance) it won't be compiled again.
Ajv does not support schemas and validated data that have circular references in objects. See [issue #802](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/802).
Ajv generates code using [doT templates](https://github.com/olado/doT) to turn JSON Schemas into super-fast validation functions that are efficient for v8 optimization.
Ajv implements formats defined by JSON Schema specification and several other formats. It is recommended NOT to use "format" keyword implementations with untrusted data, as they use potentially unsafe regular expressions - see [ReDoS attack](#redos-attack).
Ajv is a part of [Tidelift subscription](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/npm-ajv?utm_source=npm-ajv&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme) - it provides a centralised support to open-source software users, in addition to the support provided by software maintainers.
Ajv is tested with these browsers:
Ajv supports all validation keywords from draft-07 of JSON Schema standard:
Ajv treats JSON schemas as trusted as your application code. This security model is based on the most common use case, when the schemas are static and bundled together with the application.

Answers "does this real domain match the domain in a cookie?".  The `str` is the "current" domain-name and the `domStr` is the "cookie" domain-name.  Matches according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.3, but it helps to think of it as a "suffix match".

Async is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions for working with [asynchronous JavaScript](http://caolan.github.io/async/global.html). Although originally designed for use with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and installable via `npm install --save async`, it can also be used directly in the browser.
Async provides around 20 functions that include the usual 'functional'
AsyncKit is licensed under the MIT license.
AsyncKit provides harness for `parallel` and `serial` iterators over list of items represented by arrays or objects.
Asynchronous iteration will continue until the end event is reached,
Asynchronous version of `compile` method that loads missing remote schemas using asynchronous function in `options.loadSchema`. This function returns a Promise that resolves to a validation function. An optional callback passed to `compileAsync` will be called with 2 parameters: error (or null) and validating function. The returned promise will reject (and the callback will be called with an error) when:
At all times, the parser object will have the following members:

At the time of writing, the latest versions of all supported parsers show the following performance characteristics on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/AndreasMadsen/htmlparser-benchmark/builds/10805007) (please note that Travis doesn't guarantee equal conditions for all tests):

Basic Usage
Basic querying means are looking for documents whose fields match the ones you specify. You can use regular expression to match strings.
Bearer authentication is supported, and is activated when the `bearer` value is
Because `p` is in scope not only within the `Node` constructor but also
Because a pure "http over http" tunnel offers no additional security
Because it understands the AST type system so thoroughly, this library
Because localForage uses async storage, it has an async API.
Because of this check, clients can always trust the `uncompressedSize` field in `Entry` objects.
Because the Buffer constructor is so powerful, you often see code like this:
Because these keys are non-enumerable, you can't discover them using a `for`-`in` loop. Because `secretKey` is a long string of random characters, you would have a lot of trouble guessing it. And because the `private` module wraps `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` to exclude the keys it generates, you can't even use that interface to discover it.
Because this can avoid duplicate declarations of things like `__extends`, `__assign`, etc., this means delivering users smaller files on average, as well as less runtime overhead.
Because this version of `p` never leaks from the enclosing function scope,

Besides the usual events, corresponding to `console` methods, the virtual console is also used for reporting errors from jsdom itself. This is similar to how error messages often show up in web browser consoles, even if they are not initiated by `console.error`. So far, the following errors are output this way:

By default parameters that would overwrite properties on the object prototype are ignored, if you wish to keep the data from those fields either use `plainObjects` as mentioned above, or set `allowPrototypes` to `true` which will allow user input to overwrite those properties. *WARNING* It is generally a bad idea to enable this option as it can cause problems when attempting to use the properties that have been overwritten.

By default this will forward all `"jsdomError"` events to `console.error`. If you want to maintain only a strict one-to-one mapping of events to method calls, and perhaps handle `"jsdomErrors"` yourself, then you can do `sendTo(console, { omitJsdomErrors: true })`.
By default, `jsdom.env` will not process and run external JavaScript, since our sandbox is not foolproof. That is, code running inside the DOM's `<script>`s can, if it tries hard enough, get access to the Node environment, and thus to your machine. If you want to (carefully!) enable running JavaScript, you can use `jsdom.jsdom`, `jsdom.jQueryify`, or modify the defaults passed to `jsdom.env`.
By default, `null` values are treated like empty strings:

CSSStyleDeclaration
CSSStyleDeclaration is a work-a-like to the CSSStyleDeclaration class in Nikita Vasilyev's [CSSOM](https://github.com/NV/CSSOM). I made it so that when using [jQuery in node](https://github.com/tmtk75/node-jquery) setting css attributes via $.fn.css() would work. node-jquery uses [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) to create a DOM to use in node. jsdom uses CSSOM for styling, and CSSOM's implementation of the [CSSStyleDeclaration](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSSStyleDeclaration) doesn't support [CSS2Properties](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties), which is how jQuery's [$.fn.css()](http://api.jquery.com/css/) operates.

Durability works similarly to major databases: compaction forces the OS to physically flush data to disk, while appends to the data file do not (the OS is responsible for flushing the data). That guarantees that a server crash can never cause complete data loss, while preserving performance. The worst that can happen is a crash between two syncs, causing a loss of all data between the two syncs. Usually syncs are 30 seconds appart so that's at most 30 seconds of data. <a href="http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html" target="_blank">This post by Antirez on Redis persistence</a> explains this in more details, NeDB being very close to Redis AOF persistence with `appendfsync` option set to `no`.

Fetch nested property "key" from object "obj", traversing objects as needed.
Field names cannot begin by '$' or contain a '.'.
Filesystem streams based on [minipass](http://npm.im/minipass).
Filters resource downloading and processing to disallow those matching the given regular expression
Finally, we have the actual implementation code. This is usually C++, although these days [some smart people are using Rust](https://github.com/servo/servo). The implementation, of course, has its own type system. So when they implement the WebIDL algorithms, they don't actually use WebIDL values, since those aren't "real" outside of specs. Instead, implementations apply the WebIDL binding rules in such a way as to convert incoming JavaScript values into C++ values. For example, if code in the browser called `doStuff(true, true)`, then the implementation code would eventually receive a C++ `bool` containing `true` and a C++ `uint32_t` containing `1`.
Finally, you can use the `filter` option to restrict which keys will be included in the stringified output.

For example, `fs.readFile()` and `fs.readdir()`: the **F** is capitalized in *File* and the **d** is not capitalized in *dir*. Perhaps a bit pedantic, but they should still be consistent. Also, Node.js has chosen a lot of POSIX naming schemes, which I believe is great. See: `fs.mkdir()`, `fs.rmdir()`, `fs.chown()`, etc.

I felt compelled to put this on github and publish to npm. I haven't tested every other big integer library out there, but the few that I have tested in comparison to this one have not even come close in performance. I am aware of the `bi` module on npm, however it has been modified and I wanted to publish the original without modifications. This is jsbn and jsbn2 from Tom Wu's original website above, with the modular pattern applied to prevent global leaks and to allow for use with node.js on the server side.

I | `rename`  | `{"z1": "path", "z2": "name"}`
I'm not sure yet what the strategy will be for modifiers, e.g. [`[Clamp]`](http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#Clamp). Maybe something like `conversions["unsigned long"](x, { clamp: true })`? We'll see.
I'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.# immediate [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/calvinmetcalf/immediate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/calvinmetcalf/immediate)

If you do not provide type information, and simply use `*`, levn will parse the input according the unambiguous "explicit" mode, which we will now detail - you can also set the `explicit` option to true manually in the [options](#options).
If you do provide type information, you can make your input more concise as the program already has some information about what it expects. Please see the [type format](https://github.com/gkz/type-check#type-format) section of [type-check](https://github.com/gkz/type-check) for more information about how to specify types. There are some rules about what levn can do with the information:
If you don't care if the value has properties beyond what you have specified, you can use the 'etc' operator `...` - eg. `{x: Boolean, ...}` will match an object with an `x` property that is a boolean, and with zero or more other properties.
If you don't specify a callback to `find`, `findOne` or `count`, a `Cursor` object is returned. You can modify the cursor with `sort`, `skip` and `limit` and then execute it with `exec(callback)`.

If you list multiple types (eg. `Number | String`), it will first attempt to cast to the first type and then validate - if the validation fails it will move on to the next type and so forth, left to right. You must be careful as some types will succeed with any input, such as String. Thus put String at the end of your list. In non-explicit mode, Date and RegExp will succeed with a large variety of input - also be careful with these and list them near the end if not last in your list.
If you load scripts asynchronously, e.g. with a module loader like RequireJS, none of the above hooks will really give you what you want. There's nothing, either in jsdom or in browsers, to say "notify me after all asynchronous loads have completed." The solution is to use the mechanisms of the framework you are using to notify about this finishing up. E.g., with RequireJS, you could do

If you're using Ajv to compile a schema (the typical use) in a browser document that is loaded with a Content Security Policy (CSP), that policy will require a `script-src` directive that includes the value `'unsafe-eval'`.
If you're using localForage in your own build system (eg. browserify or
If you're using this in one or more of your libraries, you _should_ use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you _should_ prefix them with your library name and use ":" to separate features. For example "bodyParser" from Connect would then be "connect:bodyParser".  If you append a "*" to the end of your name, it will always be enabled regardless of the setting of the DEBUG environment variable.  You can then use it for normal output as well as debug output.
If your datastore is persistent, the indexes you created are persisted in the datafile, when you load the database a second time they are automatically created for you. No need to remove any `ensureIndex` though, if it is called on a database that already has the index, nothing happens.

If your schema uses asynchronous formats/keywords or refers to some schema that contains them it should have `"$async": true` keyword so that Ajv can compile it correctly. If asynchronous format/keyword or reference to asynchronous schema is used in the schema without `$async` keyword Ajv will throw an exception during schema compilation.

Levn aims to concisely describe JavaScript values in text, and allow for the extraction and validation of those values. Levn uses [type-check](https://github.com/gkz/type-check) for its type format, and to validate the results. MIT license. Version 0.3.0.
Levn can use the type information you provide to choose the appropriate value to produce from the input. For the same input, it will choose a different output value depending on the type provided. For example, `parse('Number', '2')` will produce the number `2`, but `parse('String', '2')` will produce the string `"2"`.
Levn is a library which allows you to parse a string into a JavaScript value based on an expected type. It is meant for short amounts of human entered data (eg. config files, command line arguments).

NeDB is compatible with all major browsers: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE9+. Tests are in the `browser-version/test` directory (files `index.html` and `testPersistence.html`).
NeDB is not intended to be a replacement of large-scale databases such as MongoDB, and as such was not designed for speed.

NeDB supports indexing. It gives a very nice speed boost and can be used to enforce a unique constraint on a field. You can index any field, including fields in nested documents using the dot notation. For now, indexes are only used to speed up basic queries and queries using `$in`, `$lt`, `$lte`, `$gt` and `$gte`. The indexed values cannot be of type array of object.

Note also that the source maps generated by Recast are character-by-character maps, so meaningful identifier names are not recorded at this time. This approach leads to higher-resolution debugging in modern browsers, at the expense of somewhat larger map sizes. Striking the perfect balance here is an area for future exploration, but such improvements will not require any breaking changes to the interface demonstrated above.

Note that as of our 7.0.0 release, jsdom requires Node.js 4 or newer ([why?](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/blob/master/Changelog.md#700)). In the meantime you are still welcome to install a release in [the 3.x series](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/tree/3.x) if you use legacy Node.js versions like 0.10 or 0.12. There are also various releases between 3.x and 7.0.0 that work with various io.js versions.
Note that at least one of the callbacks (`done`, `onload`, or `created`) is required, as is one of `html`, `file`, or `url`.

Note: A **Streams3** version of through2 is available in npm with the tag `"1.0"` rather than `"latest"` so an `npm install through2` will get you the current Streams2 version (version number is 0.x.x). To use a Streams3 version use `npm install through2@1` to fetch the latest version 1.x.x. More information about Streams2 vs Streams3 and recommendations see the article **[Why I don't use Node's core 'stream' module](http://r.va.gg/2014/06/why-i-dont-use-nodes-core-stream-module.html)**.

Note: You can use an empty string, `{group: ''}`, to get a blank line in help
Note: the `_id` is automatically indexed with a unique constraint, no need to call `ensureIndex` on it.
Note: when using `arrayFormat` set to `'comma'`, you can also pass the `commaRoundTrip` option set to `true` or `false`, to append `[]` on single-item arrays, so that they can round trip through a parse.
Note: your results may vary, so please always check on your hardware.

Okay, so let's suppose we want to compile the selector `a b` again, for right-to-left execution. We start by _parsing_ the selector, which means we turn the selector into an array of the building-blocks of the selector, so we can distinguish them easily. That's what the [`css-what`](https://github.com/fb55/css-what) module is for, if you want to have a look.

One of the goals of jsdom is to be as minimal and light as possible. This section details how someone can change the behavior of `Document`s before they are created. These features are baked into the `DOMImplementation` that every `Document` has, and may be tweaked in two ways:

Optional string, a key comment used by some formats (eg the `ssh` format).
Optionally it accepts abort function (should be synchronously return by iterator for each item), and terminates left over jobs upon an error event. For specific iteration order built-in (`ascending` and `descending`) and custom sort helpers also supported, via `asynckit.serialOrdered` method.
Optionator is a JavaScript option parsing and help generation library used by [eslint](http://eslint.org), [Grasp](http://graspjs.com), [LiveScript](http://livescript.net), [esmangle](https://github.com/estools/esmangle), [escodegen](https://github.com/estools/escodegen), and [many more](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/optionator).
Optionator uses [type-check](https://github.com/gkz/type-check) and [levn](https://github.com/gkz/levn) behind the scenes to cast and verify input according the specified types.
Options
Options are provided by in a second argument, which should be an
Options can have properties `separator` (string used to separate errors, ", " by default) and `dataVar` (the variable name that dataPaths are prefixed with, "data" by default).

Other functions are deterministic and will continue working.
Other helpful features include reformatting the help text based on the size of the console, so that it fits even if the console is narrow, and accepting not just an array (eg. process.argv), but a string or object as well, making things like testing much easier.

Otherwise, `expiryTime()` returns `Infinity` and `expiryDate()` returns a `Date` object for "Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT" (latest date that can be expressed by a 32-bit `time_t`; the common limit for most user-agents).

Our mission is to get something very close to a headless browser, with emphasis more on the DOM/HTML side of things than the CSS side. As such, our primary goals are supporting [The DOM Standard](http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/) and [The HTML Standard](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/). We only support some subset of these so far; in particular we have the subset covered by the outdated DOM 2 spec family down pretty well. We're slowly including more and more from the modern DOM and HTML specs, including some `Node` APIs, `querySelector(All)`, attribute semantics, the history and URL APIs, and the HTML parsing algorithm.

Parses given `htmlFragment`. Returns `documentFragment` node. Optional `contextElement` argument specifies context in which given `htmlFragment` will be parsed (consider it as setting `contextElement.innerHTML` property). If `contextElement` argument is not specified then `<template>` element will be used as a context and fragment will be parsed in 'forgiving' manner.
Parses specified `html` string. Returns `document` node.
Parses the contents of `str` (a string) as an integer. On success, the integer
Parses the expression, throws a `SyntaxError` if it fails, otherwise returns an array containing two elements.
Parsing does not distinguish between parameters with and without equal signs. Both are converted to empty strings.
Parsing multiple files
Pass `true` in `opts.cycles` to stringify circular property as `__cycle__` - the result will not be a valid JSON string in this case.

Regardless the measures you take, using untrusted schemas increases security risks.
Registers a new selector, with the matching regular expression and the appropriate resolver function, in the selectors table.
Registers a new symbol and its matching resolver in the operators table. Example:
Remove a cookie from the store (see notes on `findCookie` about the uniqueness constraint).
Remove a node from the list, preserving referential integrity of head
Remove added/cached schema. Even if schema is referenced by other schemas it can be safely removed as dependent schemas have local references.
Remove the object from this tree.
Removes all cookies from the jar.
Removes custom or pre-defined keyword so you can redefine them.
Removes matching cookies from the store.  The `path` parameter is optional, and if missing means all paths in a domain should be removed.
Removes unreachable code branches in `if` statements, ternaries `?`, and logical operations `||` `&&`, where the test is determinable (like comparing two constants). This is similar to what [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2)'s "dead_code" compressor option does, but without the extra code transformations.

Separately from its type system, WebIDL defines a ["binding"](http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#ecmascript-binding) of the type system into JavaScript. This contains rules like: when you pass a JavaScript value to the JavaScript method that manifests a given WebIDL operation, how does that get converted into a WebIDL value? For example, a JavaScript `true` passed in the position of a WebIDL `boolean` argument becomes a WebIDL `true`. But, a JavaScript `true` passed in the position of a [WebIDL `unsigned long`](http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#idl-unsigned-long) becomes a WebIDL `1`. And so on.

So, if you want to remove a file or a directory regardless of whether it has contents, just call `fs.remove(path)`. If you want to copy a file or a directory whether it has contents, just call `fs.copy(source, destination)`. If you want to create a directory regardless of whether its parent directories exist, just call `fs.mkdirs(path)` or `fs.mkdirp(path)`.
So, parse5 is as fast as simple specification incompatible parsers and ~15-times(!) faster than the current specification compatible parser available for the node.
So, what exactly did change and why? In 0.2 we changed some defaults to parse
So, you see, the claim I made at the beginning of this README remains
SocksClient establishes SOCKS proxy connections to remote destination hosts. These proxy connections are fully transparent to the server and once established act as full duplex streams. SOCKS v4, v4a, v5, and v5h are supported, as well as the connect, bind, and associate commands.
SocksClient supports creating connections using callbacks, promises, and async/await flow control using two static factory functions createConnection and createConnectionChain. It also internally extends EventEmitter which results in allowing event handling based async flow control.

The API is designed to mimic the behavior of `tar(1)` on unix systems.
The API is optimized for convenience: you can throw any type at it, and it will try to do
The API mainly provides 3 functions: `insert`, `search` and `delete`. If you do not create a unique-type binary search tree, you can store multiple pieces of data for the same key. Doing so with a unique-type BST will result in an error being thrown. Data is always returned as an array, and you can delete all data relating to a given key, or just one piece of data.

The _source_ and _destination_ must both be synchronous `Store`s. If one or both stores are asynchronous, use `.clone` instead. Recall that `MemoryCookieStore` supports both synchronous and asynchronous API calls.
The `*` character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has
The `.lastAccessed` property of the returned cookies will have been updated.
The `.lastAccessed` property will always be different between the two objects (to the precision possible via JavaScript's clock).  Both `.creation` and `.creationIndex` are guaranteed to be the same.  Stores MAY ignore or defer the `.lastAccessed` change at the cost of affecting how cookies are selected for automatic deletion (e.g., least-recently-used, which is up to the store to implement).
The `DEBUG` environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or
The `DefaultHandler` and the `RssHandler` were renamed to clarify their purpose (to `DomHandler` and `FeedHandler`). The old names are still available when requiring `htmlparser2`, your code should work as expected.
The `DomHandler` (known as `DefaultHandler` in the original `htmlparser` module) produces a DOM (document object model) that can be manipulated using the [`DomUtils`](https://github.com/fb55/DomUtils) helper.
The `DomHandler`, while still bundled with this module, was moved to its [own module](https://github.com/fb55/domhandler). Have a look at it for further information.

The `jsdom.jsdom` method does fewer things automatically; it takes in only HTML source, and it does not allow you to separately supply scripts that it will inject and execute. It just gives you back a `document` object, with usable `document.defaultView`, and starts asynchronously executing any `<script>`s included in the HTML source. You can listen for the `'load'` event to wait until scripts are done loading and executing, just like you would in a normal HTML page.
The `newCookie` and `oldCookie` objects MUST NOT be modified.
The `nextMethod` argument passed to `extend`'s second argument is the
The `onload` callback is called along with the window's `'load'` event. This means it will only be called if creation succeeds without error. Note that by the time it has called, any external resources will have been downloaded, and any `<script>`s will have finished executing.

The `top` property on `window` is marked `[Unforgeable]` in the spec, meaning it is a non-configurable own property and thus cannot be overridden or shadowed by normal code running inside the jsdom window, even using `Object.defineProperty`. However, if you're acting from outside the window, e.g. in some test framework that creates jsdom instances, you can override it using the special `jsdom.reconfigureWindow` function:
The `totalSize` is a Number and indicates the total file size of the zip file.
The `transformFunction` must have the following signature: `function (chunk, encoding, callback) {}`. A minimal implementation should call the `callback` function to indicate that the transformation is done, even if that transformation means discarding the chunk.
The `typeFull` property on the Buffer instance gets set to the entire
The `typeOf` property is the type the value should be, and `validate` is a function which should return true if the value is of that type. `validate` receives one parameter, which is the value that we are checking.

The base script adds `\p{Letter}` and its alias `\p{L}`, but other Unicode categories, scripts, blocks, and properties require addon packages. Try these next examples after additionally including `unicode-scripts.js`:
The basic idea is to turn every part of the selector into a function, which takes an element as its only argument. The function checks whether a passed element matches its part of the selector: If it does, the element is passed to the next turned-into-a-function part of the selector, which does the same. If an element is accepted by all parts of the selector, it _matches_ the selector and double rainbow ALL THE WAY.
The best performance is achieved when using compiled functions returned by `compile` or `getSchema` methods (there is no additional function call).

The coercion rules, as you can see from the example, are different from JavaScript both to validate user input as expected and to have the coercion reversible (to correctly validate cases where different types are defined in subschemas of "anyOf" and other compound keywords).

The resulting list will be checked for applicability to the current request according to the RFC (domain-match, path-match, http-only-flag, secure-flag, expiry, etc.), so it's OK to use an optimistic search algorithm when implementing this method.  However, the search algorithm used SHOULD try to find cookies that `domainMatch()` the domain and `pathMatch()` the path in order to limit the amount of checking that needs to be done.

The traditional approach of executing CSS selectors, named left-to-right execution, is to execute every component of the selector in order, from left to right _(duh)_. The execution of the selector `a b` for example will first query for `a` elements, then search these for `b` elements. (That's the approach of eg.

The upside of all this is that implementations can abstract all the conversion logic away, letting WebIDL handle it, and focus on implementing the relevant methods in C++ with values of the correct type already provided. That is payoff of WebIDL, in a nutshell.
The user has provided us with this implementation:
The utility spits out the syntax tree as JSON data.
The value of "$data" should be a [JSON-pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) to the data (the root is always the top level data object, even if the $data reference is inside a referenced subschema) or a [relative JSON-pointer](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-luff-relative-json-pointer-00) (it is relative to the current point in data; if the $data reference is inside a referenced subschema it cannot point to the data outside of the root level for this subschema).

There are two types of named arguments: boolean flags (eg. `--problemo`, `-p`) which take no value and result in a `true` if they are present, the falsey `undefined` if they are not present, or `false` if present and explicitly prefixed with `no` (eg. `--no-problemo`). Named arguments with values (eg. `--tseries 800`, `-t 800`) are the other type. If the option has a type `Boolean` it will automatically be made into a boolean flag. Any other type results in a named argument that takes a value.

Think of this style as a home-grown version of the first style. Note, however, that it requires a full implementation of ES5's `Object.defineProperty` method in order to make any safety guarantees, whereas the first example will provide safety even in environments that do not support `Object.defineProperty`.

This is a historical repository for the early development of the JSON Schema specification and implementation. This package is considered "finished": it holds the earlier draft specification and a simple, efficient, lightweight implementation of the original core elements of JSON Schema. This repository does not house the latest specifications nor does it implement the latest versions of JSON Schema. This package seeks to maintain the stability (in behavior and size) of this original implementation for the sake of the numerous packages that rely on it. For the latest JSON Schema specifications and implementations, please visit the [JSON Schema site](https://json-schema.org/) (or the [respository](https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec)).

This is a new backwards-compatible feature of `tough-cookie` version 2.5, so not all Stores will implement it efficiently. For Stores that do not implement `removeAllCookies`, the fallback is to call `removeCookie` after `getAllCookies`. If `getAllCookies` fails or isn't implemented in the Store, that error is returned. If one or more of the `removeCookie` calls fail, only the first error is returned.

This package simply tells you whether or not a string matches the [`Name`](http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#NT-Name) or [`QName`](http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names/#NT-QName) productions in the XML Namespaces specification. We use it for implementing the [validate](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#validate) algorithm in jsdom, but you can use it for whatever you want.
This package's main module's default export is an object with a variety of methods, each corresponding to a different WebIDL type. Each method, when invoked on a JavaScript value, will give back the new JavaScript value that results after passing through the WebIDL conversion rules. (See below for more details on what that means.) Alternately, the method could throw an error, if the WebIDL algorithm is specified to do so: for example `conversions["float"](NaN)` [will throw a `TypeError`](http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#es-float).
This package's main module's default export takes a string and will return an object of the form `{ success, error }`, where `success` is a boolean and if it is `false`, then `error` is a string containing some hint as to where the match went wrong.

URI encoded strings work too:
URI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.
URI.js has an extensive test suite, and works in all (Node.js, web) environments. It weighs in at 6.4kb (gzipped, 17kb deflated).
URI.js is an [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) compliant, scheme extendable URI parsing/validating/resolving library for all JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js, etc).
URI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:
URL-encoded forms are simple.
URN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.
USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
UUIDs can be generated from the command line with the `uuid` command.
Undefined properties are not copied. However, properties inherited from the object's prototype will be copied over.
Under the hood, NeDB's persistence uses an append-only format, meaning that all updates and deletes actually result in lines added at the end of the datafile, for performance reasons.

Validate data using passed schema (it will be compiled and cached).
Validates schema. This method should be used to validate schemas rather than `validate` due to the inconsistency of `uri` format in JSON Schema standard.
Validates the stream's length against an expected length and maximum limit.
Validating function returns a boolean value. This function has properties `errors` and `schema`. Errors encountered during the last validation are assigned to `errors` property (it is assigned `null` if there was no errors). `schema` property contains the reference to the original schema.
Validation errors will be available in the `errors` property of Ajv instance (`null` if there were no errors).
Validation function for an asynchronous custom format/keyword should return a promise that resolves with `true` or `false` (or rejects with `new Ajv.ValidationError(errors)` if you want to return custom errors from the keyword function).
Validation result will be a promise that resolves with validated data or rejects with an exception `Ajv.ValidationError` that contains the array of validation errors in `errors` property.

We have a dilemma though. How do you consistently name methods that perform the following POSIX commands: `cp`, `cp -r`, `mkdir -p`, and `rm -rf`?
We might also want to extend the API to give better error messages, e.g. "Argument 1 of HTMLMediaElement.fastSeek is not a finite floating-point value" instead of "Argument is not a finite floating-point value." This would require passing in more information to the conversion functions than we currently do.

We're using the GitHub [releases][changelog] for changelog entries.
WebIDL, as part of its madness-inducing design, has its own type system. When people write algorithms in web platform specs, they usually operate on WebIDL values, i.e. instances of WebIDL types. For example, if they were specifying the algorithm for our `doStuff` operation above, they would treat `x` as a WebIDL value of [WebIDL type `boolean`](http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#idl-boolean). Crucially, they would _not_ treat `x` as a JavaScript variable whose value is either the JavaScript `true` or `false`. They're instead working in a different type system altogether, with its own rules.

Webpack, please upgrade to 1.3.0 or above.
Well, NV wants to keep CSSOM fast (which I can appreciate) and CSS2Properties aren't required by the standard (though every browser has the interface). So I figured the path of least resistence would be to just modify this one class, publish it as a node module (that requires CSSOM) and then make a pull request of jsdom to use it.

What I hope to eliminate are the brain-wasting tasks, the tasks that are bottlenecked by keystrokes, the tasks that can be expressed as operations on the _syntactic structure_ of your code. Specifically, my goal is to make it possible for you to run your code through a parser, manipulate the abstract syntax tree directly, subject only to the constraints of your imagination, and then automatically translate those modifications back into source code, without upsetting the formatting of unmodified code.
What's actually going on here, conceptually, is pretty weird. Let's try to explain.
What's needed?
Whatever mitigation you choose, please assume all formats provided by Ajv as potentially unsafe and make your own assessment of their suitability for your validation scenarios.
When  encountering   a  syntax   error,  the   parser  will   raise  a
When `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy` are set, they will be used to proxy non-SSL requests that do not have an explicit `proxy` configuration option present. Similarly, `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy` will be respected for SSL requests that do not have an explicit `proxy` configuration option. It is valid to define a proxy in one of the environment variables, but then override it for a specific request, using the `proxy` configuration option. Furthermore, the `proxy` configuration option can be explicitly set to false / null to opt out of proxying altogether for that request.
When `wrapper` is set to `none`, `NodeVM` behaves more like `VM` for synchronous code.
When a field in a document is an array, NeDB first tries to see if there is an array-specific comparison function (for now there is only `$size`) being used
When a malformed zipfile is encountered, the default behavior is to crash (throw an exception).
When actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one `debug()` call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke `debug()` before requesting a resource, and after as well, the "+NNNms" will show you how much time was spent between calls.

When the associate command is sent to a SOCKS v5 proxy server, it sets up a UDP relay that allows the client to send UDP packets to a remote host through the proxy server, and also receive UDP packet responses back through the proxy server.
When the bind command is sent to a SOCKS v4/v5 proxy server, the proxy server starts listening on a new TCP port and the proxy relays then remote host information back to the client. When another remote client connects to the proxy server on this port the SOCKS proxy sends a notification that an incoming connection has been accepted to the initial client and a full duplex stream is now established to the initial client and the client that connected to that special port.

When you are validating user inputs all your data properties are usually strings. The option `coerceTypes` allows you to have your data types coerced to the types specified in your schema `type` keywords, both to pass the validation and to use the correctly typed data afterwards.
When you finish manipulating the AST, let `recast.print` work its magic:
When you pass in a URI in which the resource referenced does not exist on the
When you submit a pull request, tests will be run against all browsers that
When your `require('optionator')`, you get a function that takes in a settings object. This object has the type:
Whenever Recast cannot reprint a modified node using the original source code, it falls back to using a generic pretty printer. So the worst that can happen is that your changes trigger some harmless reformatting of your code.
Whenever order of the jobs' execution is important please use `serialOrdered` method._
Whenever the programmer intended to create an uninitialized `Buffer` you often see code
Where `n` is the amount of objects in the sub-tree of the given `root`:
Which then can be used to increment further:
While each of these may be desirable in some contexts, there are also times when
While keeping you sure you are using standard `inherits`
While this behaviour is unexpected (issues [#129](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/129), [#134](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/134)), it is correct. To have the expected behaviour (both objects are allowed and additional properties are removed) the schema has to be refactored in this way:
While this method can be used to extend pre-defined keywords, it can also be used to completely change their meaning - it may lead to unexpected results.
While this works, it has some downsides: Children of `a`s will be checked multiple times; first, to check if they are also `a`s, then, for every superior `a` once, if they are `b`s. Using [Big O notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), that would be `O(n^(k+1))`, where `k` is the number of descendant selectors (that's the space in the example above).
White space is ignored. The root node is a __Types__.
Whitespace between special characters and elements is inconsequential.
Who uses it
Why another node.js option parsing lib?
Why not just issue a pull request?
Why the name?  NPM modules `cookie`, `cookies` and `cookiejar` were already taken.
Why?

With CoffeeScript it looks like this:
With Optionator, if you mistype an option, it will give you an error (with a suggestion for what you meant).
With [ajv-keywords](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-keywords) package Ajv also supports validation keywords from [JSON Schema extension proposals](https://github.com/json-schema/json-schema/wiki/v5-Proposals) for JSON Schema standard:
With [component](http://component.io) do
With [npm](http://npmjs.org) do
With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:
With [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) do:
With [option `removeAdditional`](#options) (added by [andyscott](https://github.com/andyscott)) you can filter data during the validation.
With [option `useDefaults`](#options) Ajv will assign values from `default` keyword in the schemas of `properties` and `items` (when it is the array of schemas) to the missing properties and items.
With `$data` option you can use values from the validated data as the values for the schema keywords. See [proposal](https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/issues/51) for more information about how it works.
With every `slice`, `join`, and re-`indent`-ation, the reprinting process maintains exact knowledge of which character sequences are original, and where in the original source they came from.
With the `includeEnv: true` config to `parser.help()` the environment
With the above function, you now can do this:
With the compiled output code, you can evaluate the code using the `vm` module
With the option `removeAdditional: true` the validation will pass for the object `{ "foo": "abc"}` but will fail for the object `{"bar": 1}`. It happens because while the first subschema in `oneOf` is validated, the property `bar` is removed because it is an additional property according to the standard (because it is not included in `properties` keyword in the same schema).
With the option value `"empty"` properties and items equal to `null` or `""` (empty string) will be considered missing and assigned defaults.
With the package [ajv-merge-patch](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-merge-patch) you can use the keywords `$merge` and `$patch` that allow extending JSON Schemas with patches using formats [JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7396)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396) and [JSON Patch (RFC 6902)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902).
Without option `allKeys: true` callback will be called only with root schema.

XRegExp and addons copyright 2007-2012 by [Steven Levithan](http://stevenlevithan.com/).
XRegExp provides augmented, extensible, cross-browser JavaScript regular expressions. You get new syntax and flags beyond what browsers support natively, along with a collection of utils to make your client-side grepping and parsing easier. XRegExp also frees you from worrying about pesky inconsistencies in cross-browser regex handling and the dubious `lastIndex` property.
XRegExp regular expressions compile to native RegExp objects, thus there is no performance difference when using XRegExp objects with native methods. There is a small performance cost when *compiling* XRegExps. If you want, however, you can use `XRegExp.cache` to avoid ever incurring the compilation cost for a given pattern more than once. Doing so can even lead to XRegExp being faster than native regexes in synthetic tests that repeatedly compile the same regex.
XRegExp supports all native ES5 regular expression syntax. It's about 3.5 KB when minified and gzipped. It works with Internet Explorer 5.5+, Firefox 1.5+, Chrome, Safari 3+, and Opera 9.5+.
XRegExp uses the Unicode 6.1 Basic Multilingual Plane.
XRegExp('[a-z]', 'ig').xexec('abc');
XRegExp(/[a-z]/ig).xexec('abc');
XRegExp.exec('10:59', time).minutes; // -> '59'
XRegExp.forEach('1a2345', /\d/, function (match, i) {
XRegExp.globalize(/[a-z]/i).xexec('abc');
XRegExp.install('natives');
XRegExp.matchChain('1 <b>2</b> 3 <b>4 a 56</b>', [
XRegExp.matchChain(html, [
XRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '<', '>', 'gy');
XRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '<div\\s*>', '</div>', 'gi', {
XRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '\\(', '\\)', 'g');
XRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '{', '}', 'g', {
XRegExp.replace('2012-02-22', date, '${month}/${day}/${year}'); // -> '02/22/2012'
XRegExp.replace('2012-02-22', date, function (match) {
XRegExp.union(['a+b*c', /(dogs)\1/, /(cats)\1/], 'i');

Yes it can!
Yes. It's surprisingly common to forget to check the type of your variables in a
Yet Another Linked List
You also get this functionality for free by default if you use `virtualConsole.sendTo`; again, see more below:
You are welcome to
You can add additional formats and replace any of the formats above using [addFormat](#api-addformat) method.
You can add custom formatters by extending the `debug.formatters` object.
You can add headings between option specs in the `options` array.  To do so,
You can add spaces, line breaks and even require amdefine with a local path, but
You can also `pipe()` from `http.ServerRequest` instances, as well as to `http.ServerResponse` instances. The HTTP method, headers, and entity-body data will be sent. Which means that, if you don't really care about security, you can do:
You can also bulk-insert an array of documents. This operation is atomic, meaning that if one insert fails due to a unique constraint being violated, all changes are rolled back.
You can also create arrays of objects:
You can also create from a buffer:
You can also decorate Error objects with additional information so that callers
You can also enable debug dynamically by calling the `enable()` method :
You can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a "-" character.
You can also just load the module for the function that you care about, if
You can also make a standard proxied `http` request by explicitly setting
You can also manually toggle this property to force the debug instance to be
You can also nest your objects, like `'foo[bar][baz]=foobarbaz'`:
You can also pass a `cause` argument, which is any other Error object:
You can also pass a string in place of options to just specify the encoding.
You can also pass in a custom comparison function.
You can also print the complete stack trace of combined `Error`s by using
You can also retrieve values from VM.
You can also set an event handler for `'load'` or other events on the window if you wish.
You can also set automatic compaction at regular intervals with `yourDatabase.persistence.setAutocompactionInterval(interval)`, `interval` in milliseconds (a minimum of 5s is enforced), and stop automatic compaction with `yourDatabase.persistence.stopAutocompaction()`.
You can also set the `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` to share certain
You can also test for `isReadable(obj)`, `isWritable(obj)` and `isDuplex(obj)` to test for implementations of Streams2 (and Streams3) base classes.
You can also use `xml2js` from
You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):
You can asynchronously compile meta-schema by passing `true` as the second parameter.
You can build a browser-ready script using [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify),
You can combine queries using logical operators:  
You can consume this PAC file with `pac-resolver` like so:
You can create a custom tree adapter so parse5 can work with your own DOM-tree implementation.
You can create multiple instances of localForage that point to different stores
You can create your own driver if you want; see the
You can debug or inspect code running in the sandbox as if it was running in a normal process.
You can define custom formats and keywords that perform validation asynchronously by accessing database or some other service. You should add `async: true` in the keyword or format definition (see [addFormat](#api-addformat), [addKeyword](#api-addkeyword) and [Defining custom keywords](#defining-custom-keywords)).
You can define custom keywords with [addKeyword](#api-addkeyword) method. Keywords are defined on the `ajv` instance level - new instances will not have previously defined keywords.
You can encode keys and values using different logic by using the type argument provided to the encoder:
You can find regular expressions used for format validation and the sources that were used in [formats.js](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/lib/compile/formats.js).
You can generate XML that declares XML namespace prefix / URI pairs with xmlns attributes.
You can get the next-level Error using `err.cause()`:
You can give `find` and `findOne` an optional second argument, `projections`. The syntax is the same as MongoDB: `{ a: 1, b: 1 }` to return only the `a` and `b` fields, `{ a: 0, b: 0 }` to omit these two fields. You cannot use both modes at the time, except for `_id` which is by default always returned and which you can choose to omit.
You can group single character arguments that use a single `-`, however all except the last must be boolean flags (which take no value). The last may be a boolean flag, or an argument which takes a value - eg. `-ba 2` is equivalent to `-b -a 2`.
You can increase performance by using precompiled scripts. The precompiled VMScript can be run multiple times. It is important to note that the code is not bound to any VM (context); rather, it is bound before each run, just for that run.
You can install TweetNaCl.js via a package manager:
You can install via npm `npm install prelude-ls`
You can iterate over streams synchronously or asynchronously in
You can learn something about `secret` by calling `.increment()`, and you
You can manually call the compaction function with `yourDatabase.persistence.compactDatafile` which takes no argument. It queues a compaction of the datafile in the executor, to be executed sequentially after all pending operations.
You can now run the unit tests by executing:
You can read more about NWMatcher [features and compliance](https://github.com/dperini/nwmatcher/wiki/Features-and-compliance) on the wiki.
You can remove a previously created index with `datastore.removeIndex(fieldName, cb)`.
You can require Ajv directly from the code you browserify - in this case Ajv will be a part of your bundle.
You can return an object containing an `abort()` function which will be called if the window is closed or stopped before the request ends.
You can run these simple benchmarks by executing the scripts in the `benchmarks` folder. Run them with the `--help` flag to see how they work.
You can run this benchmark yourself by doing:
You can set database information with the `config()` method.
You can simply extend debugger 
You can sort and paginate results using the cursor API (see below).
You can specify some options by second/third constructor argument, or over `key.setOptions()` method.
You can still use intermediate proxies, the requests will still follow HTTP forwards, etc.
You can store any type in localForage; you aren't limited to strings like in
You can stream any response to a file stream.
You can structure your validation logic across multiple schema files and have schemas reference each other using `$ref` keyword.
You can swap your `require('stream')` with `require('readable-stream')`
You can then build regular expressions using named subpatterns, for readability and pattern reuse:
You can then match recursive constructs using XRegExp pattern strings as left and right delimiters:
You can use NeDB as an in-memory only datastore or as a persistent datastore. One datastore is the equivalent of a MongoDB collection. The constructor is used as follows `new Datastore(options)` where `options` is an object with the following fields:
You can use `count` to count documents. It has the same syntax as `find`. For example:
You can use `fs.writeFileSync` option `{flag: 'a'}` to achieve this.
You can use `fs.writeFile` option `{flag: 'a'}` to achieve this.
You can use it with a URL
You can use localForage with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/):
You can use regular expressions in two ways: in basic querying in place of a string, or with the `$regex` operator.
You can use standard projections to restrict the fields to appear in the results (see below).
You can use the `charsetSentinel` option to announce the character by
You can use the dot notation to navigate inside nested documents, arrays, arrays of subdocuments and to match a specific element of an array.
You can use this function to (optionally) initialize an object right after its creation,
You can validate your JSON schemas against [this meta-schema](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/lib/refs/json-schema-secure.json) to check that these recommendations are followed:
You could add a `--completion` hidden option to your tool that emits the
You don't ever need to include the original `fs` module again:
You don't have time? You can support NeDB by sending bitcoins to this address: 1dDZLnWpBbodPiN8sizzYrgaz5iahFyb1
You may add a comment to remind you of what the type is for by following an identifier with a `::` before a type (or multiple types). The comment is simply thrown out.
You may also use `allowSparse` option to parse sparse arrays:
You may check for multiple types by separating types with a `|`. The checker proceeds from left to right, and passes if the value is any of the types - eg. `String | Boolean` first checks if the value is a string, and then if it is a boolean. If it is none of those, then it returns false.
You may optionally use `=` to separate option names from values, for example: `--count=2`.
You may override this by setting the `indices` option to `false`:
You may override this to use dot notation by setting the `allowDots` option to `true`:
You may pass an object with the following properties:
You may pull in just the part of this semver utility that you need, if you
You may specify an index as well:
You may use the `arrayFormat` option to specify the format of the output array:
You may use the `sort` option to affect the order of parameter keys:
You might wonder why, using `console.dir` or `console.log` the output at some
You must `unpipe()` the `readStream` from any destination before calling `readStream.destroy()`.
You must explicitly specify the names of the functions that should be

_Example:_
_For backward compatibility with `v1.x` an [async/callback API](docs/async.md) is also provided_
_Note: Since _object_ is an _unordered_ collection of properties,
_Note:_ in version 2.3.3, tough-cookie limited the number of spaces before the `=` to 256 characters. This limitation has since been removed.
_Optional_. Produces an `Array` of all cookies during `jar.serialize()`. The items in the array can be true `Cookie` objects or generic `Object`s with the [Serialization Format] data structure.
_Optional_. Removes all cookies from the store.

__How is this different than JSON?__ levn is meant to be written by humans only, is (due to the previous point) much more concise, can be validated against supplied types, has regex and date literals, and can easily be extended with custom types. On the other hand, it is probably slower and thus less efficient at transporting large amounts of data, which is fine since this is not its purpose.

__Please note__:
__Please note__:  Ajv does not implement validation of the keywords `examples`, `contentEncoding` and `contentMediaType` but it reserves them. If you want to create a plugin that implements some of them, it should remove these keywords from the instance.
__Please note__: Ajv uses the [method chaining syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining) for all methods with the prefix `add*` and `remove*`.
__Please note__: If the keyword is validating data type that is different from the type(s) in its definition, the validation function will not be called (and expanded macro will not be used), so there is no need to check for data type inside validation function or inside schema returned by macro function (unless you want to enforce a specific type and for some reason do not want to use a separate `type` keyword for that). In the same way as standard keywords work, if the keyword does not apply to the data type being validated, the validation of this keyword will succeed.
__Please note__: If you use `removeAdditional` option with `additionalProperties` keyword inside `anyOf`/`oneOf` keywords your validation can fail with this schema, for example:
__Please note__: JSON Schema draft-07 also defines formats `iri`, `iri-reference`, `idn-hostname` and `idn-email` for URLs, hostnames and emails with international characters. Ajv does not implement these formats. If you create Ajv plugin that implements them please make a PR to mention this plugin here.
__Please note__: The suggestions above to prevent slow validation would only work if you do NOT use `allErrors: true` in production code (using it would continue validation after validation errors).
__Please note__: To use Ajv with draft-06 schemas you need to explicitly add the meta-schema to the validator instance:
__Please note__: [Changes in version 7.0.0-beta](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/releases/tag/v7.0.0-beta.0)
__Please note__: [Option](#options) `missingRefs` should NOT be set to `"ignore"` or `"fail"` for asynchronous compilation to work.
__Please note__: `propertyNames` keyword schema validation errors have an additional property `propertyName`, `dataPath` points to the object. After schema validation for each property name, if it is invalid an additional error is added with the property `keyword` equal to `"propertyNames"`.
__Please note__: all asynchronous subschemas that are referenced from the current or other schemas should have `"$async": true` keyword as well, otherwise the schema compilation will fail.
__Please note__: every time a validation function or `ajv.validate` are called `errors` property is overwritten. You need to copy `errors` array reference to another variable if you want to use it later (e.g., in the callback). See [Validation errors](#validation-errors)
__Please note__: every time this method is called the errors are overwritten so you need to copy them to another variable if you want to use them later.
__Please note__: following all these recommendation is not a guarantee that validation of untrusted data is safe - it can still lead to some undesirable results.
__Please note__: if you need to use "format" keyword to validate untrusted data, you MUST assess their suitability and safety for your validation scenarios.
__Please note__: if you pass a scalar value to the validating function its type will be coerced and it will pass the validation, but the value of the variable you pass won't be updated because scalars are passed by value.
__Please note__: schemas compiled before the keyword is removed will continue to work without changes. To recompile schemas use `removeSchema` method and compile them again.
__Please note__: some formats that Ajv implements use [regular expressions](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/lib/compile/formats.js) that can be vulnerable to ReDoS attack, so if you use Ajv to validate data from untrusted sources __it is strongly recommended__ to consider the following:
__Please note__: some frameworks, e.g. Dojo, may redefine global require in such way that is not compatible with CommonJS module format. In such case Ajv bundle has to be loaded before the framework and then you can use global Ajv (see issue [#234](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/234)).
__Please note__: the default value is inserted in the generated validation code as a literal, so the value inserted in the data will be the deep clone of the default in the schema.
__Please note__: this benchmark runs against the available test cases. To choose the most performant library for your application, it is recommended to benchmark against your data and to NOT expect this benchmark to reflect the performance difference in your application.

`"data:text/plain,abc"`, the charset is set to the empty string. The spec only
`$data` reference is resolved safely - it won't throw even if some property is undefined. If `$data` resolves to `undefined` the validation succeeds (with the exclusion of `const` keyword). If `$data` resolves to incorrect type (e.g. not "number" for maximum keyword) the validation fails.
`$data` reference is supported in the keywords: const, enum, format, maximum/minimum, exclusiveMaximum / exclusiveMinimum, maxLength / minLength, maxItems / minItems, maxProperties / minProperties, formatMaximum / formatMinimum, formatExclusiveMaximum / formatExclusiveMinimum, multipleOf, pattern, required, uniqueItems.

`callback` gets `(err, readStream)`, where `readStream` is a `Readable Stream`.
`callback` is effectively passed directly to `fromFd()`.
`callback` must be defined.
`callback` takes parameters `(err)`.
`cast` is a function which receives three arguments, the value under question, options, and the typesCast function. In `cast`, attempt to cast the value into the specified type. If you are successful, return an object in the format `{type: 'Just', value: CAST-VALUE}`, if you know it won't work, return `{type: 'Nothing'}`.  You can use the `typesCast` function to cast any child values. Remember to pass `options` to it. In your function you can also check for `options.explicit` and act accordingly.
`cause`          | any Error object | Indicates that the new error was caused by `cause`.  See `cause()` below.  If unspecified, the cause will be `null`.
`cdata` - The text of a `<![CDATA[` block. Since `<![CDATA[` blocks can get

`constructorOpt` | function         | If specified, then the stack trace for this error ends at function `constructorOpt`.  Functions called by `constructorOpt` will not show up in the stack.  This is useful when this class is subclassed.
`consumer.sourceContentFor(s)` will succeed for every source `s` in
`consumer.sources`.
`createWriteStream` that operate on a shared file descriptor and provides
`create`, this is a readable stream of the generated archive.  For
`customTypes` allows you to set up custom types for validation. The value of this is an object. The keys of the object are the types you will be matching. Each value of the object will be an object having a `typeOf` property - a string, and `validate` property - a function.
`customTypes` is an object whose keys are the name of the types, and whose values are an object with three properties, `typeOf`, `validate`, and `cast`. For more information about `typeOf` and `validate`, please see the [custom types](https://github.com/gkz/type-check#custom-types) section of type-check.
`cwd` is missing, or not a directory, then an error will be emitted.
`data` is optional.  It is either a Buffer that should be interpreted

`db.update(query, update, options, callback)` will update all documents matching `query` according to the `update` rules:  
`debug` exposes a function; simply pass this function the name of your module, and it will return a decorated version of `console.error` for you to pass debug statements to. This will allow you to toggle the debug output for different parts of your module as well as the module as a whole.
`default` keywords in other cases are ignored:

`end` is exclusive, so `_readStreamForRange(0x1000, 0x2000)` would indicate to read `0x1000` bytes.
`entry` and `end` events are only ever emitted in response to this method call.
`entry` must be an `Entry` object from this `ZipFile`.
`err.connect` property is set to `true`.
`error_list` is an array of at least one `Error` object.
`error` - Indication that something bad happened. The error will be hanging

`flattenObject` would return.  `flattenIter(obj, depth, func)` is logically
`force` argument will suppress this behavior (overriding any previous mapping).
`fs-extra` adds file system methods that aren't included in the native `fs` module and adds promise support to the `fs` methods. It also uses [`graceful-fs`](https://github.com/isaacs/node-graceful-fs) to prevent `EMFILE` errors. It should be a drop in replacement for `fs`.
`fs-extra` is a drop in replacement for native `fs`. All methods in `fs` are attached to `fs-extra`. All `fs` methods return promises if the callback isn't passed.
`fs-extra` wouldn't be possible without using the modules from the following authors:
`fs.createReadStream`. This gives you two choices:
`fs.createWriteStream` do not give you. These features are:
`fs.createWriteStream` will solve the problem if you only create one of them
`fs` module functions.
`generateHelpForOption` produces expanded help text for the specified with `optionName` option. If an `example` was specified for the option, it will be displayed,  and if a `longDescription` was specified, it will display that instead of the `description`.
`generateHelp` produces help text based on your settings.

`name`           | string           | Describes what kind of error this is.  This is intended for programmatic use to distinguish between different kinds of errors.  Note that in modern versions of Node.js, this name is ignored in the `stack` property value, but callers can still use the `name` property to get at it.
`name`        | string | Programmatically-usable name of the error.

`optionator` is written in [LiveScript](http://livescript.net/) - a language that compiles to JavaScript. It uses [levn](https://github.com/gkz/levn) to cast arguments to their specified type, and uses [type-check](https://github.com/gkz/type-check) to validate values. It also uses the [prelude.ls](http://preludels.com/) library.
`options` (`object`, default `undefined`): Pass in any `fs.readFileSync` options or set `reviver` for a [JSON reviver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse).
`options` (`object`, default `undefined`): Pass in any `fs.readFile` options or set `reviver` for a [JSON reviver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse).
`options` is an optional object which can contain:

`parseExpressionAt`, and `tokenizer` that match the top-level
`parseInt()`, `Number()`, and [strtol(3C)](https://illumos.org/man/3C/strtol).
`parseType` parses string `type` written in the [type format](#type-format) into an object representing the parsed type.
`parse` casts the string `input` into a JavaScript value according to the specified `type` in the [type format](https://github.com/gkz/type-check#type-format) (and taking account the optional `options`) and returns the resulting JavaScript value.
`parse` processes the `input` according to your settings, and returns an object with the results.
`parsedTypeCheck` checks a JavaScript value `input` against parsed `type` in the parsed type format (and taking account the optional `options`) and returns whether the `input` matches the `type`. Use this in conjunction with `parseType` if you are going to use a type more than once.
`parsedTypeParse` casts the string `input` into a JavaScript value according to the specified `type` which has already been parsed (and taking account the optional `options`) and returns the resulting JavaScript value. You can parse a type using the [type-check](https://github.com/gkz/type-check) library's `parseType` function.

`request.defaults` to add/override defaults that were previously defaulted.
`requestOptions` is an object holding the same options that the Node.js
`request` is also aware of the `NO_PROXY`/`no_proxy` environment variables. These variables provide a granular way to opt out of proxying, on a per-host basis. It should contain a comma separated list of hosts to opt out of proxying. It is also possible to opt of proxying when a particular destination port is used.

`request` supports `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data` form uploads. For `multipart/related` refer to the `multipart` API.
`request` supports both streaming and callback interfaces natively. If you'd like `request` to return a Promise instead, you can use an alternative interface wrapper for `request`. These wrappers can be useful if you prefer to work with Promises, or if you'd like to use `async`/`await` in ES2017.
`request` supports making requests to [UNIX Domain Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket). To make one, use the following URL scheme:

`require('levn');` returns an object that exposes three properties. `VERSION` is the current version of the library as a string. `parse` and `parsedTypeParse` are functions.
`require('optionator');` returns a function. It has one property, `VERSION`, the current version of the library as a string. This function is called with an object specifying your options and other information, see the [settings format section](#settings-format). This in turn returns an object with three properties, `parse`, `parseArgv`, `generateHelp`, and `generateHelpForOption`, which are all functions.

`type-check` is a library which allows you to check the types of JavaScript values at runtime with a Haskell like type syntax. It is great for checking external input, for testing, or even for adding a bit of safety to your internal code. It is a major component of [levn](https://github.com/gkz/levn). MIT license. Version 0.3.2. Check out the [demo](http://gkz.github.io/type-check/).
`type-check` is written in [LiveScript](http://livescript.net/) - a language that compiles to JavaScript. It also uses the [prelude.ls](http://preludels.com/) library.
`type-check` uses `Object.toString` to find out the basic type of a value. Specifically,
`typeCheck` checks a JavaScript value `input` against `type` written in the [type format](#type-format) (and taking account the optional `options`) and returns whether the `input` matches the `type`.
`typeMap` is a map of type -> extensions, as documented in `new Mime`, above.

jsdom includes support for using the [canvas](https://npmjs.org/package/canvas) package to extend any `<canvas>` elements with the canvas API.

If jsdom can find the canvas package, it will use it, but if it's not present, then `<canvas>` elements will behave like `<div>`s.

The breaking changes introduced by v3 are composed by the combined breaking changes in [Node v9](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v9.0.0/) and [Node v10](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v10.0.0/), as follows:
validate(data).then(successFunc).catch(errorFunc);
validate({ userId: 1, postId: 19 })
validates cookie attributes for semantic correctness.  Useful for "lint" checking any Set-Cookie headers you generate.  For now, it returns a boolean, but eventually could return a reason string -- you can future-proof with this construct:
value `-0`.
