Compiled Version [HERE](https://github.com/securesean/DecryptAutoLogon/blob/main/DecryptAutoLogon/bin/Release/DecryptAutoLogon.exe)Compiled with .NET 3.0 (Windows Vista's default)+. Needs to be run as SYSTEM. Not just as a high intgrity process because the special registry keys need are only visible to SYSTEM and can only be decyrpted by SYSTEM. 
In order to support Kiosk mode Windows needs to keep the user's password in a reversable format. This was being kept at HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon under "DefaultUserName" and "DefaultPassword" . Autologon was updated to store the passwords in the LSA Secrets registry keys that are only visible to SYSTEM. [keithga ](https://keithga.wordpress.com/2013/12/19/sysinternals-autologon-and-securely-encrypting-passwords/) provided a binary that popped a Message but no source code or command line version.
So thanks to who actually did the work: keithga, frohwalt
This tool can extract/decrypt the password that was stored in the LSA by SysInternals [AutoLogon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autologon).
