        "body": "### Go & Phish - Official Gophish integration released!\r\nYou can learn more about this update in the official blog post: https://breakdev.org/evilginx-3-3-go-phish/\r\n\r\n### CHANGELOG\r\n- Feature: Official GoPhish integration, using the fork: https://github.com/kgretzky/gophish\r\n- Feature: Added support to load custom TLS certificates from a public certificate file and a private key file stored in `~/.evilginx/crt/sites/<hostname>/`. Will load `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem` pair or a combination of a `.pem`/`.crt` (public certificate) and a `.key` (private key) file. Make sure to run without `-developer` flag and disable autocert retrieval with `config autocert off`.\r\n- Feature: Added ability to inject `force_post` POST parameters into JSON content body (by [@yudasm_](https://twitter.com/yudasm_)).\r\n- Feature: Added ability to disable automated TLS certificate retrieval from LetsEncrypt with `config autocert <on/off>`.\r\n- Feature: Evilginx will now properly recognize origin IP for requests coming from behind a reverse proxy (nginx/apache2/cloudflare/azure).\r\n- Fixed: Infinite redirection loop if the lure URL path was the same as the login path defined in the phishlet.\r\n- Fixed: Added support for exported cookies with names prefixed with `__Host-` and `__Secure-`.\r\n- Fixed: Global `unauth_url` can now be set to an empty string to have the server return `403` on unauthorized requests.\r\n- Fixed: Unauthorized redirects and blacklisting would be ignored for `proxy_hosts` with `session: false` (default) making it easy to detect evilginx by external scanners.\r\n- Fixed: IP address `127.0.0.1` is now ignored from being added to the IP blacklist.\r\n- Fixed: Added support for more TLDs to use with phishing domains (e.g. `xyz`, `art`, `tech`, `wiki`, `lol` & more)\r\n- Fixed: Credentials will now be captured also from intercepted requests.",
        "body": "- **Feature**: Create and set up pre-phish HTML templates for your campaigns. Create your HTML file and place `{lure_url_html}` or `{lure_url_js}` in code to manage redirection to the phishing page with any form of user interaction. Command: `lures edit <id> template <template>`\r\n- **Feature**: Create customized hostnames for every phishing lure. Command: `lures edit <id> hostname <hostname>`.\r\n- **Feature**: Support for routing connection via SOCKS5 and HTTP(S) proxies. Command: `proxy`.\r\n- **Feature**: IP blacklist with automated IP address blacklisting and blocking on all or unauthorized requests. Command: `blacklist`\r\n- **Feature**: Custom parameters can now be embedded encrypted in the phishing url. Command: `lures get-url <id> param1=value1 param2=\"value2 with spaces\"`.\r\n- **Feature**: Requests to phishing urls can now be rejected if User-Agent of the visitor doesn't match the whitelist regular expression filter for given lure. Command: `lures edit <id> ua_filter <regexp>`\r\n- List of custom parameters can now be imported directly from file (text, csv, json). Command: `lures get-url <id> import <params_file>`.\r\n- Generated phishing urls can now be exported to file (text, csv, json). Command: `lures get-url <id> import <params_file> export <export_file> <text|csv|json>`.\r\n- Fixed: Requesting LetsEncrypt certificates multiple times without restarting. Subsequent requests would result in \"No embedded JWK in JWS header\" error.\r\n- Removed setting custom parameters in lures options. Parameters will now only be sent encoded with the phishing url.\r\n- Added `with_params` option to `sub_filter` allowing to enable the sub_filter only when specific parameter was set with the phishing url.\r\n- Made command help screen easier to read.\r\n- Improved autofill for `lures edit` commands and switched positions of `<id>` and the variable name.\r\n- Increased the duration of whitelisting authorized connections for whole IP address from 15 seconds to 10 minutes.\r\n",
        "body": "- Added option to capture custom POST arguments additionally to credentials. Check `custom` field under `credentials`.\r\n- Added feature to inject custom POST arguments to requests. Useful for silently enabling **\"Remember Me\"** options, during authentication.\r\n- Restructured phishlet YAML config file to be easier to understand (phishlets from previous versions need to be updated to new format).\r\n- Removed `name` field from phishlets. Phishlet name is now determined solely based on the filename.\r\n- Now when any of `auth_urls` is triggered, the redirection will take place **AFTER** response cookies for that request are captured.\r\n- Regular expression groups working with `sub_filters`.\r\n- Phishlets are now listed in a table.\r\n- Phishlet fields are now selectively lowercased and validated upon loading to prevent surprises.\r\n- All search fields in the phishlet are now regular expressions by default. Remember about proper escaping!"
        "body": "- Feature: Listening IP and external IP can now be separated with `config ipv4 bind <bind_ipv4_addr>` and `config ipv4 external <external_ipv4_addr>` to help with properly setting up networking.\r\n- Fixed: Session cookies (cookies with no expiry date set) are now correctly captured every time. There is no need to specify `:always` key modifier for `auth_tokens` to capture them.\r\n- Fixed: Captured custom tokens are now displayed properly and values are not truncated.\r\n",
        "body": "- Feature: TLS certificates from LetsEncrypt will now get automatically renewed.\r\n- Feature: Automated retrieval and renewal of LetsEncrypt TLS certificates is now managed by `certmagic` library.\r\n- Feature: Authentication tokens can now be captured not only from cookies, but also from response body and HTTP headers.\r\n- Feature: Phishing pages can now be embedded inside of iframes.\r\n- Feature: Changed redirection after successful session capture from `Location` header redirection to injected Javascript redirection.\r\n- Feature: Changed config file from `config.yaml` to `config.json`, permanently changing the configuration format to JSON.\r\n- Feature: Changed open-source license from GPL to BSD-3.\r\n- Feature: Added `always` modifier for capturing authentication cookies, forcing to capture a cookie even if it has no expiration time.\r\n- Feature: Added `phishlet <phishlet>` command to show details of a specific phishlet.\r\n- Feature: Added phishlet templates, allowing to create child phishlets with custom parameters like pre-configured subdomain or domain. Parameters can be defined anywhere in the phishlet file as `{param_name}` and every occurence will be replaced with pre-configured parameter values of the created child phishlet.\r\n- Feature: Added `phishlet create` command to create child phishlets from template phishlets.\r\n- Feature: Renamed lure `templates` to lure `redirectors` due to name conflict with phishlet templates.\r\n- Feature: Added `{orig_hostname}` and `{orig_domain}` support for `sub_filters` phishlet setting.\r\n- Feature: Added `{basedomain}` and `{basedomain_regexp}` support for `sub_filters` phishlet setting.\r\n- Fixed: One target can now have multiple phishing sessions active for several different phishlets.\r\n- Fixed: Cookie capture from HTTP packet response will not stop mid-term, ignoring missing `opt` cookies, when all authentication cookies are already captured.\r\n- Fixed: `trigger_paths` regexp will now match a full string instead of triggering true when just part of it is detected in URL path.\r\n- Fixed: Phishlet table rows are now sorted alphabetically.\r\n- Fixed: Improved phishing session management to always create a new session when lure URL is hit if session cookie is not present, even when IP whitelist is set.\r\n- Fixed: WebSocket connections are now properly proxied.",
        "body": "- Feature: URL redirects on successful token capture now work dynamically on every phishing page. Pages do not need to reload or redirect first for the redirects to happen.\r\n- Feature: Lures can now be paused for a fixed time duration with `lures pause <id>`. Useful when you want to briefly redirect your lure URL when you know sandboxes will try to scan them.\r\n- Feature: Added phishlet ability to intercept HTTP requests and return custom responses via a new `intercept` section.\r\n- Feature: Added a new optional `redirect_url` value for phishlet config, which can hold a default redirect URL, to redirect to, once tokens are successfully captured. `redirect_url` set for the specific lure will override this value.\r\n- Feature: You can now override globally set unauthorized redirect URL per phishlet with `phishlet unauth_url <phishlet> <url>`.\r\n- Fixed: Disabled caching for HTML and Javascript content to make on-the-fly proxied content replacements and injections more reliable.\r\n- Fixed: Improved JS injection by adding `<script src\"...\">` references into HTML pages, instead of dumping the whole script there.\r\n- Fixed: Blocked requests will now redirect using javascript, instead of HTTP location header.\r\n- Fixed: Changed `redirect_url` to `unauth_url` in global config to avoid confusion.\r\n- Fixed: Fixed HTTP status code response for Javascript redirects.\r\n- Fixed: Javascript redirects now happen on `text/html` pages with valid HTML content.\r\n- Fixed: Removed `ua_filter` column from the lures list view. It is still viewable in lure detailed view.",
        "body": "- Proxy can now create most of required `sub_filters` on its own, making it much easier to create new phishlets.\r\n- Added lures, with which you can prepare custom phishing URLs with each having its own set of unique options (`help lures` for more info).\r\n- Added OpenGraph settings for lures, allowing to create enticing content for link previews.\r\n- Added ability to inject custom Javascript into proxied pages.\r\n- Injected Javascript can be customized with values of custom parameters, specified in lure options.\r\n- Deprecated `landing_path` and replaced it with `login` section, which contains the domain and path for website's login page.\r\n\r\nBlog: https://breakdev.org/evilginx-2-3-phishermans-dream/"
